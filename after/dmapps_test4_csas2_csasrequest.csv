The AIS-NCP in Gulf Region is currently conducting a review of a project aiming to deposit rotenone (NoxFish Fish Toxicant II)to eradicate Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu)of Miramichi Lake, Lake Brook and a 15km stretch of Southwest Miramichi under s.19 of the AIS Regulations. There are 2 main effectiveness monitoring of treatment that the AIS authorizations should be considering for each project:
1-Monitoring of treatment efficacy, which refers to the measurements related to achieving the intented deleterious substance levels in the treatment area and the verification that those concentrations were sufficient to achieve toxicity levels required for mortality of target species.
2-Monitoring of eradication success, which refers to the measurement of presence of the target species after the treatment.
The methodology currently used to monitoring the treatment efficacy (1) is in-situ bioassay, following the SOP 14.1 from the rotenone SOP Manual, 2nd edition (https://1fjduf35czd41a05pgltrtej-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/rotenone-stewardship/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2019/08/Rotenone-SOP-Manual-2nd-Edition.pdf ). Basically, the in-situ bioassay involves
placing fish in some enclosure (cage, bucket or net bag) within the affected waters at different depths to measure the sensitive of the fish to the rotenone in the environment.

The AIS-NCP recognized that these questions might not be within the DFO science scope/ mandate and are interested in a discussion on how to address them, even if required to involve other federal departments at regional or national level.
In relation to monitoring to measure the eradication success (2), the question will focus on Miramichi Lake, Lake Brook and the 15km of the Southwest Miramichi River.

Questions often asked by everyone (public, Indigenous communities, ENGOs) about this type of projects are: how long after the application of the deleterious substance will the ecosystem take to recover? Will the ecosystem completely recover? Although, the answers for these questions might not be a requirement under the AISR, the recovery of the treated area needs to be considered as part of the assessment and authorization monitoring conditions because of other factors (e.g. Indigenous communities concerns, impact on other activities, including fisheries management objectives). Since, the AISR are relatively new and there are not many s.19 AISR authorized projects to collect enough information on ecosystem recovery after a deposit of deleterious substances, there is a need to include monitoring requirements under the s.19 AISR authorizations. 
The science advice requested is 1) how to define "" minimum ecological recovery"" and ""ideal ecological recovery"" for various types if habitat, but more specifically lakes, brooks and river systems? (e.g. Should we consider that an ecosystem is recovered after the deposit of a deleterious substance, only when the exact same community species are present? or would having a similar food web/ trophic levels be enough?) and 2) what monitoring criteria and timelines are necessary to demonstrate both types of recovery.  The intention is to have a biological/ecological criteria scale to define the minimal to an ideal recovery of an ecosystem (in this case, a lake, brook and river) that could be used to guide the AIS-NCP on the monitoring requirements under s.19 authorizations for the ecosystem recovery aspect of a project.","","The information/advice will guide the AIS-NCP (Gulf region) and potentially the national program in informing what criteria should be considered for monitoring of ecosystem recovery for aquatic environments after the deposit of deleterious substances.

Les plies côtières sont très prisées par les homardiers qui l’utilisent comme appât. 
 
Les données provenant des observateurs en mer indiquent que les prises accidentelles de homard dans ces pêches dirigées n’ont cessé d’augmenter au cours des dernières années (aucune donnée disponible en 2020 en raison de l'arrêté de gestion pour la Covid-19). Il est difficile de quantifier l’ampleur du problème puisque le taux de couverture par les observateurs en mer est de 10%, mais avec l’abondance actuelle du homard, on suppose que les prises accessoires de homard sont à la hausse dans la pêche aux plies côtières.

Slocum gliders launched in the GSL have been analyzed for the detection of Sei Whale calls, but not all acoustic devices, including bottom-mounted recorders and other archival acoustic systems, have been analyzed for this species. The Species at Risk Program (SARP) is asking if the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat to analyze all acoustic devices, and their archived data, in the GSL to determine the presence and frequency for  Sei Whales in the GSL. 

Specific questions that seek to be addressed include:

- What is the distribution and frequency of occurrence of the species in the inland seas of the Atlantic coast (e.g. Gulf of St. Lawrence);
- Has the frequency of detections in the Gulf of St. Lawrence changed in recent years, coinciding with recent shifts in use of this area by other species? If so, what are the trends observed?","","This request is important for the determination as to whether or not the SARP Gulf Region should be a supporting region for Sei Whale. The Sei Whale is under consideration for listing under the Species at Risk Act, Schedule 1. The information will also assist the preparation of a Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA), which was recently deemed unfeasible due to the lack of information and data on this species in Canadian waters.","Without science advice, Species at Risk Program, Gulf Region may not be a support region on Sei Whale because of a lack of data and evidence of the presence of the species in this region. Should the species in fact occur in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Species at Risk Program would lack funds and resources to contribute to the listing recommendation, conservation, and recovery planning, as a result of their decision to not be a supporting region.

Most of the water sampling has typically been conducted in the summer, as it is thought that freshwater mussels shed more particles of their DNA into the environment at higher temperatures. In some cases, mostly for logistical reasons, samples have been taken in early to mid-fall. Water temperatures may decrease rapidly in the fall, which in turn decreases the metabolism of freshwater mussels and might reduce the amount of Brook Floater DNA present in river environment. Therefore, it is unknown whether Brook Floater can be reliably detected during the fall and in colder river temperatures through water samples and eDNA analysis. The Species at Risk Program (SARP) is asking the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat these two main questions:

- Is there an effect of temperature on the ability to detect Brook Floater eDNA in river environments? If so, what is the water temperature threshold at which sufficient detection of Brook Floater eDNA is no longer possible?

- Closely related members of freshwater mussels have been shown to burrow into the substrate during the fall, coinciding with lower water temperatures. As such, would the burrowing behaviour of Brook Floater in response to cold temperatures and/or timing decrease the amount of DNA shed by Brook Floater into the river environment and thus affect the likelihood and ability to detect Brook Floater through eDNA? It is unknown to what depths Brook Floater may burrow in lower temperatures and during the fall.","","Sampling and analysis for eDNA is a primary detection tool of Brook Floater in freshwater environments throughout its range. It allows the Species at Risk Program to refine where further survey efforts should take place, which helps to define the actual distribution and range of the species more accurately and efficiently. The request would clarify and properly define the parameters in which eDNA sampling can reliably be used to inform recovery planning. Therefore, reducing the risk of inaccurate eDNA sampling results result in better decisions and outcomes regarding the recovery planning, conservation, and protection of the species.","As water sampling and analysis for Brook Floater eDNA is being conducted later in the year (Fall), there is already a risk that results obtained are inaccurate and misinforming recovery planning and operations. Should science advice not be provided, there is a risk of false negatives for Brook Floater presence in freshwater habitats, preventing the Species at Risk Program and other regulatory measures from effective recovery planning, conservation measures, and protection from environmental effects (both cumulative and temporary).","2021-08-15 03:00:00","Water sampling for eDNA analysis for field season (May to September) 2021 is already being planned by Species at Risk Program, as well as by external organizations as part of their grants and contribution programs and species at risk recovery and protection operations. External organizations are sampling later in the season (September, October, and November) in 2020 and are highly likely to continue in 2021 and beyond. Should science advice be provided by September 2021, DFO can inform organizations whether eDNA sampling later in the year (fall) is still an accurate detection method or not.

Current
mortality estimates for White Hake in bycatch fisheries were determined to have ""negligible effects on the population trajectory because of the extremely high natural mortality rates experience by this population” (SAR 2016/034).However, if fishing effort increases (i.e. proposed expansion of the redfish fishery), the impacts of bycatch fisheries on this population may no longer be considered negligible. SARP would like to know whether the increase in catch levels for red fish will increase the probability of extinction of the SGSL White Hake population or result in extinction sooner, and if there may be the potential for management measures to reduce White Hake bycatch in this fishery. As part of this request, SARP and RM would like Science to:
1. Provide up-to-date mortality estimates for SGSL White Hake as bycatch in directed fisheries and total mortality of all bycatch fisheries.
1. Provide an estimate of the potential change in White Hake mortality at various redfish catch levels.
1. Identify the proportion of the potential redfish fishing effort that overlaps with White Hake grounds and where this overlap is greatest.
1. Provide information on the vertical distribution of White Hake in the deeper waters where they now occur, as well as the seasonal variation in this vertical distribution.
1. Provide the distribution of White Hake along the Laurentian slope and determine if sectors would be less prone to bycatch.","","SARP requires this informationin anticipation of a listing recommendation for SGSL White Hake. In the development of management scenarios as part of the listing process, assumptions were made that bycatch fisheries could be permitted under a SARA listing scenario; however, catch level increases in the redfish fishery may change the ability to issue permits for these fisheries if bycatch-related mortality becomes significant and jeopardizes species survival. SARP needs to know the allowable harm levels and the likelihood of the redfish fishery reaching these levels with proposed catch level increases. In the absence of a listing decision, this information will be necessary for the development of an alternative approach plan, which is required for species that are not listed under SARA. Based on the Precautionary Approach model, RM will be using findings from the science assessment as a guiding piece to evaluate the scale and extent of White Hake total and fishery-specific by-catch removals and the potential impacts associated with a catch level increase in Redfish fishery in order to develop options for a rebuilding plan for the sGSL White Hake stock Information/Advice Use:The Science Response will provide the information needed to meet the requirements of the listing and recovery processes under SARA. The science advice will help inform the recommendation of whether or not to list the species under SARA, and provide information that will help inform the potential management decisions under listing and do not list scenarios,including the issuance of SARA permits.

Les plies côtières sont très prisées par les homardiers qui l’utilisent comme appât.

Les prises accidentelles de homard dans ces pêches dirigées se sont avérées très importantes en 2018, (par exemple, 368 kg de homard pour une seule journée de pêche à la limande à queue jaune par un seul pêcheur) les données de 2019 ne sont pas encore traitées. Il est difficile de quantifier l’ampleur du problème puisque le taux de couverture par les observateurs est seulement de 10% mais avec l’abondance actuelle du homard, on peut raisonnablement croire que les prises accessoires de homard sont à la hausse dans la pêche des plies côtières. La manipulation inutile et la capture du homard dans des engins qui ne sont pas adaptés pour lui pose un risque pour la conservation du homard.

The end user is Resource Management.

Canada is a signatory to the 2002 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. Under the agreement Canada committed to implementing the precautionary approach in the fisheries it manages. Canada is also signatory to numerous UN Sustainable Fisheries resolutions calling on states to apply the precautionary approach and put in place measures to help ensure sustainable fisheries. This advice is required to meet these commitments.

Peer reviewed science advice on harvest levels is required under the Department's ""A fishery decision-making framework incorporating the Precautionary Approach."" This is one of several policies under the Department's ""Sustainable Fisheries Framework,"" which is the framework the Department has adopted to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries management.

The inshore lobster stocks have been identified as ""primary"" stocks in the Maritimes Region's ""Priority Setting Protocol for Fishery Assessment and Management: Primary and Secondary Stocks in the Maritimes Region"" (2012). In addition, one of the Minister’s priorities in her mandate letter is to “use scientific evidence and the precautionary principle . . . when making decisions affecting fish stocks and ecosystem management.” The advice is required to meet the Minister’s mandate commitment.","If science advice is not provided, a decision about the harvest levels (i.e. TAC) will be based on the most recent science advice available.

",Irene Andrushchenko,"Questions about whether current ASO levels are adequate to effectively monitor the bycatch of depleted species have been raised during the SARA listing processes for multiple depleted groundfish species, including Cusk, White hake, Atlantic cod and Winter skate (4VW). A commitment to answer the question about ASO levels was included in the regionally-approved Cusk AAP to support the DNL under SARA recommendation, and a similar commitment is likely to get included in the AAP for White hake as well. In addition, it is anticipated that Winter skate may be recommended for listing under SARA and our ability to effectively monitor bycatch of this species will be an important component of implementing SARA requirement for this species.

In addition to SARA DNL and list considerations for these species, there is concern that cod is being discarded and that landings data do not accurately depict fishing mortality. 4X5Y cod is in the critical zone and is anticipated to be listed on Batch 2 of the Fish Stock Provisions.    
 
This request relates to the biodiversity objective of the EAM Framework to control unintended incidental mortality. 

DFO is beginning to implement the Fishery Monitoring Policy (FMP) at the operational level. This request supports the application of the policy and will also inform management decisions related to the deployment of observers in the fishery.  One of the objectives of the policy is to have dependable, timely and accessible fishery information necessary to help ensure that Canadian fisheries are managed to support the sustainable harvest of aquatic species. 

A review of the observer coverage levels in the 4VWX5 groundfish fishery (and at fleet levels) as proposed will assist in the implementation of the FMP policy in the fishery in two primary ways:
• It will provide timely, dependable information related to the ability of current observer coverage levels to provide sufficient information to allow for an assessment of estimated bycatch of depleted species.   
• It will provide an assessment which will allow resource managers to, if and where required, amend, increase or shift at-sea observer resources to ensure they are sufficient to provide estimates of bycatch for each of the species noted as a priority.   

","If advice on sufficient levels of ASO coverage to monitor these depleted species is not provided, it will remain uncertain whether we have adequate information to accurately assess the level of risk fisheries bycatch is posing to these COSEWIC-assessed, depleted species, and also uncertain whether current management measures (e.g., quota caps, trip limits) are sufficient to address this risk. This situation is inconsistent with the Departmental priority of protection of COSEWIC-assessed or depleted species, and addressing this knowledge gap has been identified as a commitment during multiple groundfish SARA listing processes. The Department will be expected to report against this commitment and our Departmental priorities for depleted species in the coming years, and determining whether current ASO levels are sufficient (and if not, what sufficient levels would be) is the necessary first step on which future management decisions for these species should be based.

If the requested science advice is not provided, it would impact the ability of DFO to apply the tool and achieve impactful results for the FMP policy.

Specifically:
 
1) Conduct a review of available fish passage technologies and operations that could be implemented  at tidal gate / aboiteau structures in Nova Scotia, and
2) Provide advice on the most appropriate technologies and operations for providing fish passage at these structures (that's accounts for different scales of structures and fish species likely to use the system) within Nova Scotia 
","FFHPP staff willing to work with DFO Science to further refine questions, as needed. ","In Nova Scotia a total area of 33,000 hectares of tidal land is protected from saltwater by a series of dykes and over 100 tidal gate structures / aboiteaus, which allow the release of freshwater but prevent or restrict the inflow of seawater during the flood tide. Many of these historic structures were built on natural rivers (e.g., Avon River, Halfway River, LaPlanche, etc.) and result in impacts to fish passage. Climate change and sea level rise has placed increasing attention on flood control structures and their maintenance/replacement. 

DFO's Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program (FFHPP) has been increasingly asked to review replacements, upgrades, and operations of these tidal gate / aboiteau structures with the goal of increasing fish passage. Given the uncertainty about the potential impacts of tidal control / aboiteau structures, having information on the effectiveness of fish passage structures is essential for supporting science-based decision-making, verifying compliance with the Fisheries Act and Species at Risk Act, and increasing DFO's knowledge and understanding of the potential effects of these structures. 

This science advice will be used to support DFO regulatory reviews and to provide expert advice to other provincial and federal government departments (e.g., Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal, Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture, and Nova Scotia Environment). 
","
If science advice is not provided, DFO will be unable to provide science-based expert advice on the effectiveness of existing and proposed structures. This could result in continuing or further impacts to fish passage or unduly restrictive requirements for proponents.

","The Canadian Marine Invasive Screening Tool (CMIST) is a screening-level risk assessment tool for marine invasive species. It is a questionnaire that follows the invasion process from arrival to impact and is designed so an informed assessor can quickly evaluate one species in an assessment area using easily accessible information from databases, primary and grey literature. The CMIST was developed through a previous CSAS process. The AIS National Core Program - Maritimes Region is interested in Science advice on the applicability of the tool in freshwater environments, specifically: 
-does the Canadian Marine Invasive Screening Tool (CMIST) provide valid risk assessments for freshwater species? 
-is there a need for a separate Canadian Freshwater Invasive Screening Tool (CFIST)? If so, how would CMIST and CFIST differ?","","In order to prioritize management actions and support evidence-based decision making, the AIS-NCP needs to know the relative risks associated with freshwater species. CMIST can provide such risk assessments for marine species and has been reportedly used for freshwater AIS. However, the results are not publicly available, nor have the amendments for using CMIST for freshwater (noted in the CMIST user manual) been made available. Therefore, a CMIST developed methodology validated for freshwater AIS would be very beneficial for regulatory purposes. Also, having a CMIST re-advertised as CFIST, Canadian Freshwater Invasive Screening Tool, with notes on the validated use of the modified CMIST methods would decrease confusion about whether or not CMIST can be used for freshwater AIS. ","If the science advice is not provided, groups, organizations, and the provincial governments applying to enact a management plan for a freshwater AIS may be confused about the process and the validity of the CMIST. This may result in these organizations either paying for an environmental consultant to conduct a risk assessment, using methods that have not been validated by DFO, or to drop the project all together due to a confusing process.   ","2022-03-31 12:00:00","AIS National Core Program - Maritimes Region is in the process of developing AIS response plans that will help facilitate AIS management projects, including for freshwater AIS.

What are the decision points and levels that determine that the risk to the wild population is too high?  

",DFO Maritimes Science Staff,"Aquaculture management is part of the Minister's mandate letter, and in order to have sustainable aquaculture, more genetic information and genetic screening tools for farmed salmon is necessary to mitigate the potential risks of aquaculture to wild conspecifics.

Improved testing methods, tools and indicators will also help in the identification and traceability of salmon and whether they are wild, aquaculture or enhancement finfish. 

Better tools will also inform the Introductions and Transfers Committees to evaluate the genetic risks and mitigate the impacts associated with the transfers of finfish. For example, there is a need for a genetic tool to identify Atlantic salmon with non-American genes to restrict their introduction in Atlantic Canadian waters. The tests, tools and indicators would be applicable to other regions seeking to reduce specific genetic interactions in new sites and with the introduction and transfers process.




","There is a need for science to proactively inform the aquaculture industry as it develops/evolves rapidly in the region. There is an increased interest in new finfish site development in Nova Scotia and in production increases in New Brunswick.
The Province of Nova Scotia, through its Traceability Committee, is looking for science advice to inform a new traceability program for salmon aquaculture and increased monitoring efforts.
 
The provinces of both NS and NB have indicated a strong interest in these assessment methods, tools and indicators. Finfish aquaculture is a significant socio-economic contributor to both provinces, but also can also effect other coastal industries and the health of the ecosystem. One of the greatest concerns expressed by the public through the media the impact of salmon aquaculture on wild salmon populations and what the governments are doing to mitigate those impacts.

Preliminary eDNA sampling began in the Maritimes region in 2019, with samples being collected, or planning to be collected, in all the MPAs in the region. The focus of this work is to evaluate the application of eDNA as a biodiversity monitoring approach. Ultimately this work will support the application of eDNA for biodiversity monitoring; however indicators identified in the established monitoring frameworks for each MPA were not conceived with eDNA in mind and thus linkages remain general at this time.

Further advice is required to develop specific indicators supported by the collection of eDNA that serve the conservation objectives of each MPA and the regional conservation network. As a relatively new science, advice is also required on how eDNA sampling designs should be implemented in each MPA (e.g., structured approach to inform spatial-temporal aspects of the survey design). This advice will help confirm and detail the use of this tool for biodiversity monitoring and help develop a long-term plan around its future collection. Therefore, the overarching questions are ""Is eDNA a useful tool to monitor biodiversity for each MPA in Maritimes Region"".

There are commitments to explain to Canadians the benefits of MPA designations, and this tool may provide a regular and consistent means in which to communicate the biodiversity of these areas in an non-invasive way.

An ecosystem overview and assessment report was published 13 years ago for the Bras d'Or Lake(Parker et al.,2007). One of the main purposes for this work was to facilitate the process of identifying ecologically and biologically significant areas(EBSAs) within the Lake ecosystem. In support of this,information gaps and recommendations were provided to guide future work on EBSA identification within the Lake. Since then, Hastings et al.,(2014)identified the entirety of the Bras d'Or Lakes inland sea as an EBSA; however, additional work is required to delineate important and sensitive sub-EBSA areas within the Lakes for consideration in bioregional conservation network planning and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) initiatives. 
 
Since the available western science traditional knowledge was compiled and assessed in Parker et al., (2007), DFO science,the Unama'ki Institute of Natural Resources, esearchers from academic institutions such as Cape Breton University, and the Bras d'Or Lakes Biosphere reserve have continued to conduct research and monitoring activities in the Lakes.

This is the same concept that allows herring eggs to be harvested under a herring allocation and then converted to adult equivalents.","Dana Haggarty, Inshore Rockfish and Lingcod Program Head","Tla'amin First Nation is requesting that a portion of its treaty allocation of Lingcod be harvestable as Lingcod eggs.  These eggs are sought as a cultural food by elders within the Nation.

Expected harvest by Tla'amin would be under 100lbs of eggs annually.This information is required for implementation of the Tla'amin Final Agreement.   Adhering to our Modern Treaty commitments is a Constitutional obligation and requirement for the Government of Canada.  The BC government is also a signatory Party to the Tla'amin Final Agreement.

These 80lbs come off their allocation at a 1:1 ratio. Part of the rationale for this is that Tla'amin has an allocation for Lingcod that does not specify which life-stage the animal must be for harvest.  If no science advice is provided, eggs may continue to be be harvested and counted as the equivalent of the same weight of adult fish.  This would increase the impact of Tla'amin's harvest on this species.  If other First Nations make similar requests, the impacts could grow quickly.","2022-04-30 03:00:00","There is no deadline that this advice needs to be received by, but the longer we go without scientific support, the greater the risks on local Lingcod stocks.

Discussions were undertaken between the SARP TKW Recovery Team, the MMU, and the Pinniped Rresearch Program.","A Broad Strategy outlined in the TKW AP is to ‘Ensure that Transient Killer Whales have an adequate and accessible food supply to allow recovery’, under which a key Approach is to ‘Minimize the risk of prey population reductions from anthropogenic activities, until precise prey needs can be determined’. Information provided via this request will contribute to the ongoing implementation of the recommended recovery measures (RM5 and RM6) included in the AP under this Broad Strategy and Approach. While abundance estimates and/or updated population assessments are underway for several other important TKW species (e.g., Steller Sea Lion), a population assessment for the Harbour Seal in Canadian Pacific waters has not been completed since 2008.
Science advice on the habitat necessary for the survival and recovery of TKW (proposed critical habitat) has been provided to SARP and incorporated into the amended RS (2020). Information provided via this request will assist in refining the features, functions and attributes of TKW critical habitat, namely the features of prey abundance, and prey distribution and sufficient geographical area, under the function of feeding and foraging.
The information provided via this request will be used by resource managers to make informed decisions regarding lethal removal of Harbour Seals including requests for FSC access and to assess applications for future commercial access). 
If, as with sea otters (Nichol et al. 2020), population demographic processes for Harbour Seals occur at smaller spatial scales than the B.C. coast, and Harbour Seals exhibit some level of site-fidelity and differing densities along the coast (e.g., per km of coast), the population impact of human-caused mortality might differ across population components/sub-regions. Advice on scientifically-defensible way(s) to assess allowable harm at a regional scale, including ways to apportion the population-wide PBR – e.g., based on density, distinct geographic region - would be highly valuable to support management decisions. 
As Harbour Seals are the primary prey of TKW and a significant consumer of important fish species, including SRKW prey species, this study will provide key data for an ecosystem approach to management. With respect to SRKW, information provided via this request may be used to inform a scientific assessment of the potential competition between Harbour Seals and SRKW.
Information will also support the Department in meeting requirements for an updated Harbour Seal population assessment for Pacific Canadian waters in support of U.S. Marine Mammal Bycatch Rules. Information may also be used for broad departmental priorities, including spill response and Marine Protected Area (MPA) planning.","An updated Harbour Seal population assessment will provide key information regarding prey availability for the Threatened TKW population in Canadian Pacific waters, allowing SARP and others working within (and outside of) the Department to continue to advance the recovery of TKW. For example, the ability to effectively protect critical habitat relies on a clear description of the functions, features and attributes of critical habitat. Data provided via this request will assist in refining critical habitat identification for TKW, thereby aiding in enforcement of an anticipated Critical Habitat Order for this population.
If advice is not provided, the potential impacts of any future allowable commercial Harbour Seal harvest on the species – as well as on reliant populations such as TKW – will remain unknown, hindering informed decision-making by departmental resource managers and communication by the Department with stakeholders regarding any decisions. Intense public scrutiny is anticipated in the event of any approved commercial harvest of Harbour Seals, including protests locally, regionally, nationally and internationally; in order for the Department to respond effectively to criticism, the most up-to-date information should be used to support actions/decisions by the Department.

Fraser River sockeye continue to remain the focus of intense First Nations, stakeholder and public interest.  In particular, considerable attention has focused on the development of harvest control rules that strike a balance between precautionary harvest management to conserve and rebuild stocks of concern while providing sustainable harvest opportunities for more abundant co-migrating populations.  To help address these concerns, the Fraser River Sockeye Spawning Initiative was begun in 2006 and led to the development of abundance based harvest decision rules for the 4 management units: Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer and Late.  However, there have been annual variations in the harvest rules employed by managers and the results of this new approach have not been formally assessed. At the same time, in recent years there has been declining productivity, climate change and the increased variability that accompanies it, and low sockeye abundances (the two lowest on record occurred in 2016 and 2019). First Nations and stakeholders want to see evidence that the current harvest decision rules developed using the FRSSI model will not exacerbate declines and lead to recovery conservation units in poor status over time. This work may also help to address the Cohen Commission recommendation 26:The Department of Fisheries and Oceans should, by September 30, 2013, complete its planned review of the Fraser River Sockeye Spawning Initiative model and address the criticisms of the model:¦ Whether the maximum total allowable mortality as a function of run size should be 60 percent; ¦ Whether the model could more explicitly state what values are being weighed and how they are weighed; and¦ Whether habitat considerations and large escapements could be brought into escapement planning.","The Department continues to face considerable pressure from many First Nations and stakeholders to demonstrate the current management approach will permit the conservation and rebuilding of  conservation units in the red zone.  At the same time,  many commercial harvesters have argued that current harvest rules are too precautionary and substantial harvest opportunity is being foregone. Also, the last version of the FRSSI model assessed by CSAS used long-term productivity which is no longer appropriate given current and likely future low productivity. An updated analysis of the FRSSI model, harvest control rules/management decision points, and uncertainties is needed to inform consultations on the implications of alternative harvest rules on these competing objectives and inform adaptive management.","2025-03-31 03:00:00",The review will inform allowable harvest levels in Canada and the United States.

Estimation of the fishing impacts in the Fraser River, Canadian marine, and US fisheries is necessary for commitments identified in the Pacific Salmon Treaty 2019 Agreement, Salmon Integrated Fishery Management Plans, and scientific assessments such as risk analyses. IFC exploitation rates have been estimated via different approaches for US, Canadian ocean, and Fraser River fisheries since 1975.  The calculation of IFC exploitation rates relies on data for spawner escapement (IFC and Lower Fraser Coho (LFC)), ocean fishery impacts, Fraser River fishery mortalities, and the escapement of Lower Fraser Coho. Currently, the latter is not estimated but it has been identified by the PSC Coho Technical Committee as the current highest priority information that is needed to estimate IFC exploitation rates, because the IFC exploitation rates are sensitive to the LFC escapement estimate when the FRAM is used to generate exploitation rates. This project focuses on the estimation of Fraser River fishery mortalities of IFC.  Since 2001, IFC mortalities in the Fraser River were based on (1) a model predicting stock composition, called the Fraser River Decay Model; (2) estimates of kept and released Coho by fishery; and, (3) incidental mortality rates by fishery.",Chuck Parken,"This project will review the data sources, methods and procedures used to estimate Interior Fraser Coho (IFC) Management Unit mortalities in the Fraser River, including the Fraser River Decay Model, estimation of kept and released Coho in Fraser River fisheries and the associated incidental mortality rates.   The Decay Model predicts the daily stock composition (percent IFC), which is multiplied by estimates of kept or released Coho in fisheries and the corresponding mortality rates to produce estimates of IFC mortalities. The mortalities are summed across fisheries and days to generate an annual estimate of the total post-season mortalities of IFC in Fraser River fisheries.  This project will produce updated estimates of IFC mortalities in Fraser River fisheries for 2001 to 2018, and potentially 2019 depending on data availability.

The absence of science advice has not had an identifiable negative effect on the species, habitats or ecosystems.

The Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) lower biological benchmark allows for substantial buffer between it and the level of abundance at which the stock would be considered at risk of extinction.  The upper biological benchmark “identifies whether harvests are greater than the level expected to provide on an average annual basis, the maximum annual catch for a CU, given existing conditions…there would not be a high probability of losing the CU”.  For stocks with stock-recruit data, the recommended upper and lower benchmarks are SGEN and .8 SMSY, respectively.  WSP biological benchmarks are defined at the Conservation Unit, or CU, scale.Under the PA, the stock limit reference point (LRP) is a biologically-defined reference that represents the status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock.  LRPs are defined at the Stock Management Unit, or SMU, scale and will be required for implementation of Bill C-68.Under the PA, the upper stock reference (USR) delimits the ‘cautious’ and ‘critical’ zones and is not strictly dependent on biological evaluation (i.e. setting the USR also involve socio-economic decisions similar to setting rebuilding targets or rebuilding exploitation rates.)   However, Science can help ‘managers’ and stakeholders set these objectives by providing results of simulation studies that evaluate the potential effect of alternate exploitation rates on stock abundance.Specific questions to be addressed include: 1. What limit-reference points (LRPs) would be recommended for Fraser River Chinook stock management units (SMUs) that are consistent with the Wild Salmon Policy (i.e. conserving biodiversity and ecosystem integrity by maintaining conservation units(CUs))?   (Note these LRPs should also be measurable within the current assessment framework and take into account uncertainty and risk.)2. What methods and associated values could be considered to support setting SMU-level USRs for Fraser River Chinook SMUs?  3. Given uncertainty in WSP habitat-based benchmarks for Fraser River Chinook, how well do they perform against stock-recruit benchmarks accounting for uncertainties and possible biases in spawner abundances, catches, recruitment estimates and age-at-maturity? 4. How would these targets taken into account, or be adjusted for, stock age and sex composition to account for differential egg production ?5. What is the effect of the following exploitation rate scenarios on Fraser River Chinook SMU abundance in relation to the recommended LRPs and USRs?Scenario 1:  Exploitation rate is limited to CYER limits set out in PST Chapter 3 for Fraser SMUs – i.e. 95% - 100% avg. 09 – 15 ER.Scenario 2: Increase exploitation rate relative to Scenario 1 by 50%.Scenario 3.  Reduce exploitation rate relative to Scenario 1 by 50%.  Scenario 4:  TMIN harvest control rule.  Limit exploitation rate to 5% or less.",Chuck Parken,"Among other suggestions, a recent CSAS (2019) review of the Fraser River Chinook management approach recommended that: ? “Clearly-defined and measurable stock and fishery objectives for stream-type Fraser Chinook salmon should be developed to guide future management responses….  While data-limitations for stream-type Fraser Chinook make the development of biologically-based benchmarks and rebuilding goals more challenging, this work is needed to support anticipated new rebuilding regulations under Bill C-68 and DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework.  Given data limitations, habitat-based (Parken et al. 2006) or percentile-based benchmarks (Holt et al. 2018) could be considered.  If rebuilding objectives were more clearly defined, the overall assessment and decision-making process would allow for more objective and transparent evaluation of the impact of relatively small fishery impacts, such as culturally important Fraser River First Nation ‘first fish’ fisheries.”And that:• “Closed-loop feedback simulations… could be used to support rebuilding efforts for these stocks by providing insights into the impacts of various harvest strategies on the probability of achieving rebuilding goals.”The evaluation requested would provide information to address those recommendations building on work that has already been done:• Provisional CU WSP benchmarks for Fraser Chinook CUs have been used to inform the COSEWIC process based on a Chinook ‘carrying capacity model’ that relates watershed area with carrying capacity (i.e. applying Parken et al. 2006).  However, the performance of this method has not been fully evaluated accounting for uncertainties in the data and harvest risk.• SMSY escapement targets were developed under the PST process for the Fraser Summer 41  and Fraser Late SMUs.• A simulation model to evaluate the effect of exploitation on rebuilding time was developed by C. Holt and C. Freshwater as part of a SPIRA project.  Although specific rebuilding targets have not been established for Fraser Chinook, this simulation tool could be used to evaluate the effect of alternate harvest strategies on stock abundance in relation to biological benchmarks, LRPs and USRs.  The results would help inform the discussion to develop rebuilding targets.The additional work under this RSIA involves:• Evaluating the performance of Fraser River Chinook WSP benchmarks developed using habitat carrying capacity model.• Recommending LRP for Fraser SMUs that consider CU diversity.  Such LRPs may build from CU WSP benchmarks.• Applying simulation tools to evaluate the effect of alternate harvest scenarios on SMU abundance in relation to recommended LRP and potential USRs such as .8 SMSY – notwithstanding diversity of CU productivity.","There is considerable concern being raised by First Nations and stakeholders about the Department's current management approach for Fraser River chinook stocks and whether management actions are achieving conservation objectives and intended fishery impact reductions by sector (i.e. First Nations, recreational and commercial).

Can a long term monitoring program be developed to assess the effectiveness of Rockfish Conservation Areas looking at stock status, recruitment and habitat indicators. 

As part of a Rockfish Conservation Strategy launched by DFO in 2002,  Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs), a spatial management measure, were proposed to reduce the fishing mortality on inshore rockfish, in concert with reductions to commercial fishery catch quotas, recreational fishery bag limits, and improvements to both catch monitoring and assessment.  In 2007, a suite of 164 RCAs were implemented which closed fisheries to maintain a near-zero fishing mortality for inshore rockfish species and fulfill the targeted closure of up to 30% of rockfish habitat within inside waters and 20% of habitats in the outside areas.  Since 2011, there has not been a monitoring program in place to assess the stock status of inshore rockfish and their habitats within and adjacent to RCAs.  In light of DFO's commitment to manage fisheries (under Sustainable Fisheries Framework and Precautionary Approach) and benthic areas (Sensitive Benthic Areas) Ecosystem and Fishery managers are requesting the development of a framework to monitor RCAs with the goal of assessing their ongoing effectiveness, if any, and identifying any improvements required to the existing RCA management to achieve the initial goal of halting the decline of inshore rockfish and promoting their sustainability.     

In addition to monitoring fish populations, it is also important to include evaluating quality of habitats in RCAs, monitoring habitat impacts from allowable activities, and collecting habitat data to improve habitat suitability models that can be used to assess the prevalence, quality and degree of patchiness of rockfish habitat in RCAs.",Dana Haggarty Sarah Dudas,"his information will be used to make future management decisions regarding Rockfish Conservation Areas - responding potentially to the impact of activities currently allowed within the RCAs and the effectiveness of RCAs as they are currently managed. 

This project will contribute to the body of scientific information used to rationalize adjustments made to harvest practices permitted within RCAs (if deemed necessary) to enable RCAs to qualify under the Marine Conservation Target OECM category, in support of the commitments made by Canada to increasing the conservation of Canada’s oceans to 25 per cent by 2025, working towards 30 per cent by 2030.","If RCAs are not monitored, Fisheries Management won't know if the activities permitted in the closures are impacting rockfish habitat and the recruitment capability of rockfish within the RCAs.  An effective long term monitoring plan is required to ensure RCAs are providing the conservation benefits necessary to rebuild and sustain inshore rockfsh populations. 

Stakeholders including the commercial fishing sector and ENGOs, are very interested in the ""Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures"" (OECM) category of the Marine Conservation Target initiative.

In 2020 discussions were held with Ken Fong, Dominique Bureau, and Paul Grant.","First Nations communities have expressed an interest in maintaining a Food, Social and Ceremonial (FSC) harvest of Northern Abalone, which are listed as Endangered under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). Currently, FSC harvest of Northern Abalone is prohibited under SARA, for conservation of the species.  

Currently, Northern Abalone are considered one coast-wide Designatable Unit (DU) in BC, based on genetics. However, Northern Abalone have a very short larvae period (8-14 days) and presumably have limited dispersal with stock recruitment occurring at local areas. It is unknown if the Northern Abalone population in BC is a metapopulation made of several local discrete densities that have limited larvae interchange. Additionally, the preliminary results from the 2011 and 2016 North and Central Coast index site surveys indicate a possible trend towards achieving recovery objectives, which suggest that recovery may be occurring in local areas along the coast.  Thus, there is a need to examine the feasibility of developing a spatial model that would take into account the patchy distribution of the population throughout the BC coast.  

This science advice is needed in order to contribute towards consultation with First Nations in light of the ongoing incidents of illegal harvest and the Department's inability to seek charge approval in the North and Central Coast. This advice is also needed to reduce Departmental legal risk on the potential infringement of First Nations right to harvest for FSC purposes.

The end users are DFO Pacific Region Fisheries Management Branch and Conservation and Protection Unit, First Nations communities, and other organizations undertaking Northern Abalone population assessments for scientific or management purposes.

Paul Grant assisted with the development of the original request and provided input on the revision.,"The Nechako White Sturgeon population is listed as Endangered under the Species at Risk Act. The population has experienced recruitment failure for ~50 years and a conservation hatchery rears and releases juveniles as a stop gap measure to address recruitment failure until natural recruitment can be restored through habitat restoration. The Freshwater Fisheries Society of BC, with support from the Nechako White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative (NWSRI), reared and released juvenile White Sturgeon from pilot hatchery between 2006 and 2009, and a full scale hatchery starting in 2014.

The Breeding Plan for Nechako White Sturgeon (2005) outlines target broodstock numbers, crosses between males and females, and sets an overall target adult population. The number of juveniles released from the hatchery is influenced by factors that change between years, including number of hatchery fish available, the status of the wild adult population estimates, estimated juvenile mortality rate, juvenile population size and distribution, and predation (e.g., otters). A concern has been raised that too many fish released would invoke migration downstream to the Fraser River and impose genetic swamping of the Fraser River populations (both up and downstream of its confluence with Nechako). This must be taken into account in the Science Advice on the hatchery release strategy. SARP is in the process of securing an external contractor to complete analysis of hatchery release, fin ray chemistry, genetics and juvenile monitoring data to inform future hatchery release strategy (numbers, frequency, genetics), and management options for hatchery fish caught in the Fraser River if they pose a genetic or demographic risk (options may include leaving them where found, removing/culling them, or repatriating them to the Nechako watershed). SARP is seeking Science Advice to review the results of these analyses and provide science advice on hatchery-origin juvenile releases and options for hatchery-origin fish caught in the Fraser River.

In 2017 and 2018 Science opinions on hatchery released were solicited informally by the Species at Risk Program primarily (provided by Ruth Whitler). Moving forward, a more formal approach to the review of NWSRI data, analyses, release numbers, and surrounding uncertainty is required.

Juvenile indexing results and adult population status data are provided to the NWSRI for a biological assessment to advise on juvenile release numbers for the following year, or for management responses to over-releases. The group looks to DFO for scientific scrutiny of these numbers and strategies. Risks posed from releasing too many juveniles include genetic swamping the wild Nechako population, and emigration of excess juveniles into the Fraser River (upstream and downstream of the Nechako), which may impact demographics (e.g., competition with wild juveniles in the Mid- and Upper- Fraser) or the genetic composition of wild Fraser Basin White Sturgeon. On the other hand, there is a risk of extirpation of the Nechako White Sturgeon population if too few hatchery juveniles are released, as the population continues to experience recruitment failure.   

The Carrier Sekani Tribal Council also is actively watching and has expressed interest in ensuring the outcome of the deliberations on juvenile release numbers are appropriate. The BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development Region 5 (Williams Lake area) and the Fraser River Sturgeon Conservation Society have significant concerns about releasing too many hatchery fish and potential impacts on wild Fraser River fish.

In 2017, DFO Species at Risk Program and Science supported the UCWSRI technical assessment and recommended a 2017 conservation effort focused on the collection of data and to further assess the long-term genetic risk to the wild population. As part of this research, DFO permitted the removal of up to 292 over-represented fish during the fall stock assessment to maintain a genetic balance important for the species’ recovery. US co-managers established ongoing fisheries in Lake Roosevelt in Washington targeting the over-represented families. Given the changing landscape, it is uncertain if additional removals are required in Canada. Advice is needed urgently as hatchery fish (broodyears 2001-02) have approached sexual maturity and, if overrepresented, may pose an immediate genetic risk to the wild population. In February 2020, SARP secured an external contractor to analyze population data and model the genetic risk to long-term recovery, and model various removal options (final report expected in winter 2020/20201).

It is anticipated there is sufficient information to identify important habitat for the Fraser River DU, and it would be advantageous to have this science advice in advance large projects getting underway. It would also be advantageous to have this advice in advance of development of a Recovery Strategy (to avoid financial and resource burden in reconsulting at a later date). If Fraser River DU and/or the Central Pacific Coast (CPC) DU are listed as Endangered under Schedule 1 of SARA, s. 41(1)(c) and 49(1)(a) require ""an identification of the species' critical habitat, to the extent possible, based on the best available information"" in a recovery strategy for endangered species.

Furthermore, if the advice is provided after the Recovery Strategy is developed, this will cost the Department significant resources. Not identifying important habitat at the earliest feasible point in the SARA recovery planning process puts the Department at increased risk for litigation and possibly raise concerns from interested Indigenous groups. Identification of critical habitat for SARA-listed species is a requirement under the Species at Risk Act (SARA s. 41(1)(c)), including the information provided by COSEWIC, examples of activities that are likely to result in its destruction, and a schedule of studies to identify critical habitat, where available information is inadequate. Protection of critical habitat is a vital component of recovery of listed SAR and a primary means of addressing threats to the species.

This is required to inform management scenarios for the Lower Fraser River White Sturgeon Species at Risk Act listing decision and inform potential exemptions, if allowable harm is available, under a list decision (i.e., allocation of allowable harm in management scenarios). 

The specific question to be answered by Science is: What level of risk to the Lower Fraser White Sturgeon population is posed by the ongoing recreational catch and release fishery from direct and latent mortality rates and sub-lethal stress?  

This advice is required to develop fully informed management scenarios for the Lower Fraser River White Sturgeon designatable unit (DU) Species at Risk Act listing process. This DU has been assessed as Threatened by COSEWIC. An RPA was completed in 2020 but it did not address this question.",Request revisions were developed based on feedback from the 2018 and 2019 RSIA submissions. Paul Grant assisted with the development of the original request and provided input on the revisions.,"COSEWIC assessed Lower Fraser River White Sturgeon as threatened in 2012. Once a species is assessed at risk by COSEWIC, the Government of Canada is required to respond to that assessment and ultimately decide whether or not that species will subsequently be listed under the Species at Risk Act. If the Government of Canada makes a decision to 'list' the Lower Fraser River White Sturgeon under SARA, DFO is legally required publish recovery documents and support recovery implementation. Even if a 'do not list' decision is made, DFO must develop a workplan describing alternative management approaches to recover the species. An understanding of the recent population trends and allowable harm is necessary to inform either recovery documents and permits or the work plan. 

During the September 2020 Lower Fraser White Sturgeon RPA CSAS meeting, participants raised concerns over the effects multiple captures and releases may have on the long-term survival and lifetime fecundity of individuals in the DU. The White Sturgeon Catch and Release Fishery guiding industry claims direct mortality levels are well below 1% of catch. Although delayed mortality or sublethal effects from the fishery were briefly discussed at the the 2020 RPA meeting, further analysis and guidance is required to inform the development of Lower Fraser River White Sturgeon management scenarios.

Tagging analysis of Lower Fraser River White Sturgeon show substantial declines in juvenile, sub-adult and possibly adult size ranges in recent years (Nelson et al. 2018, Nelson et al. 2019, Challenger et al. 2019 all at https://www.frasersturgeon.com/research-for-survival-reports/), these declines were supported by the population modeling exercise for the recent Lower Fraser RPA Working Paper (separate CSAS process that is currently in the publication stage). Over the same period of population declines, recreational catch and release fishery activity has increased substantially (based on FLNRORD data).    

Halvorson et al. (2017) [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jai.13557] surveyed White Sturgeon carcasses with evidence of angling which indicated an average of 0.7% mortalities per angling trip.  Recent catch rates of ~70,000 White Sturgeon per year (White Sturgeon Management Committee 2018) would suggest that inexperienced anglers may contribute substantial risk to the population. Additional context is available through a SARP essay dated 2 October 2018.    

The degree to which non-lethal effects of angling on fish, such as reduced growth (Cooke et al. 2013) [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2012.00867.x] may factor into reduced growth rates noted by Nelson et al. 2018).  McLean et al. (2016) [http://www.frasersturgeon.com/media/Conserv%20Physiol-2016-McLean-conphys-cow031%20(3).pdf] found quantifiable levels of stress from simulated angling encounters on White Sturgeon.  
Temperature at time of angling plays a factor in stress levels found by McLean et al. (2016).  Would stress from angling also be responsible for sublethal effects such as on reduced reproductive success through resorption of eggs and or contribute to the failing White Sturgeon juvenile population?  Guiding industry voluntary closures and pending FLRNORD regulations to avoid angling White Sturgeon at spawning sites during spawning period would appear to recognize this potential.  

More specifically, given the above context we request a quantitative risk assessment of direct and latent White Sturgeon mortalities and sub-lethal stresses inflicted by current catch and release fisheries on the tidal and non-tidal portions of the lower Fraser River. Further, please advise as to where the risks posed by an ongoing catch and release fishery on Lower Fraser White Sturgeon fall in relation to allowable harm modeling conducted for that population.   

The Science Advice will contribute to facilitating recovery and management actions for the species. SARA's preamble recognizes the importance of conserving Canada's biodiversity, and the Act is central to meeting Canada's commitments under the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity. Information on the potential impacts of the Catch and Release Fishery is required to develop management scenarios to inform the listing decision.  

End users of this advice may be: Ecosystems Management Branch - SARP; provincial co-managers including MoE and FLNRORD; FRWSCS.","If Science Advice is not received, DFO will be unable to develop fully informed management scenarios for the Lower Fraser River White Sturgeon Species at Risk Act listing process. In the listing process is delayed, there is also a risk of delaying recovery actions, critical habitat protection and permitting/exempting decisions, if listed. The Science Advice is required to inform potential exemptions, if allowable harm is available, under a list decision (i.e., allocation of allowable harm in management scenarios). Without the advice, DFO risks imposing full or partial closures of the recreational catch and release fishery when it is unwarranted, not closing the recreational catch and release fishery when it is warranted, and not being able to substantiate appropriate mitigative actions to be implemented upon posting of a listing decision. Arriving at either an underestimate of impacts, or a list of mitigative measures that would be inadequate to control impacts to White Sturgeon within allowable harm limits could jeopardize population recovery. Conversely, an over-estimate of impacts and excessive mitigation may also lead to unnecessary and contentious socio-economic costs.

Lower Fraser White Sturgeon are an iconic species with considerable public, media and government interest in the species, and the involvement of a variety of stakeholders at the local, and regional levels. SARA listing, protection and recovery of species at risk remains of significant public, ENGO, and media interest.","2021-05-31 03:00:00","Science advice on the sublethal and lethal effects of the Catch and Release Fishery on the Lower Fraser White Sturgeon DU is required to inform management scenarios for the Lower Fraser River White Sturgeon listing decision and inform potential exemptions, if allowable harm is available, under a list decision (i.e., allocation of allowable harm in management scenarios).

Is an adjustment to the current geographic boundaries of critical habitat of this species required?

This advice is required to ensure critical habitat is properly identified and protected for Speckled Dace and is essential to supporting recovery for the species.

In Canada, Speckled Dace is restricted to the Kettle, West Kettle and Granby rivers in the Columbia River drainage and is listed under SARA as endangered. Speckled Dace critical habitat was identified in a 2018 recovery strategy. At the time, the species' entire distribution may not have been known. The recovery strategy includes a schedule of studies that indicates that ground-truthing of the critical habitat in the three river sections in the West Kettle, Kettle, and Granby rivers has not been done, and that Speckled Dace may undergo downstream migration in winter to locations removed from feeding and spawning areas. An understanding of Speckled Dace habitat utilization is incomplete. Outstanding schedule of studies items in the recovery strategy may help guide re-identification.",Paul Grant assisted with the development of the original 2019 request and provided input on the 2020 resubmission.,"Speckled Dace is listed as Endangered under the Species at Risk Act. Sections 41(1)(c) and 49(1)(a) of the Species at Risk Act (SARA) require ""an identification of the species' critical habitat, to the extent possible, based on the best available information"" in a recovery strategy and/or action plan for a threatened or endangered species.

Research on Speckled Dace life history and habitat use would help estimate the threat caused to different life stages. The refinement and re-identification of critical habitat may help inform the following provincial initiatives:
1. The development of a Kettle River Watershed Management Plan that includes provisions to preserve flows and examine aspects of riparian vegetation to develop a case for riparian management. Minimum flow requirements and riparian management actions would likely benefit Speckled Dace.
2. The British Columbia Forest and Range Evaluation program (FREP) evaluates stream ecosystem function. In 2012, the FREP identified areas along the Kettle River watershed where riparian function has been impacted. The severity of this threat is uncertain, but overlaps in urban development and critical habitat would be useful for future land use planning.

Additionally, refinement of critical habitat would be used to inform Authorizations and any associated offsetting as required by the Fisheries Act. It may also have implications for a recent Teck Resources projects to protect a tailings impoundment from flood erosion on the Kettle River directly adjacent to critical habitat for Speckled Dace.

SARA's mandate recognizes the importance of conserving Canada's biodiversity, and the Act is central to meeting Canada's commitments under the UN Convention on Biodiversity. Further, conservation and management of SARA-listed species supports the Department's national objectives of conserving biodiversity and habitat. And supports the Department's strategic outcome of maintaining sustainable aquatic ecosystems and Theme III, Protecting Nature through management of species at risk. Specifically, this advice will support implementation of the legally-required Recovery Strategy for Speckled Dace in Canada (2018),  is in keeping with Section 6 ""Purposes of Species at Risk Act"",  and will contribute to facilitating population and distribution objectives for the species. As stated in the preamble to SARA, success in the recovery of this species depends on the commitment and cooperation of many different constituencies that will be involved in the implementation of recovery actions and will not be achieved by DFO or any other jurisdiction alone. Sections 41(1)(c) and 49(1)(a) of the Species at Risk Act (SARA) require ""an identification of the species' critical habitat, to the extent possible, based on the best available information"" in a recovery strategy and/or action plan for a threatened or endangered species.

End users of this advice may be: Ecosystems Management Branch - SARA Program; provincial co-managers including MoE and FLNRORD.","Protection of critical habitat is essential to maintaining Speckled Dace population and distribution objectives.

Refinement and re-identification of Speckled Dace may help inform initiatives for water use, riparian management, and land use planning.

Breeding season surveys are undertaken on a 4 year cycle, and will be undertaken again in summer of 2021 (confirmed).
DFO has conducted 14 breeding season aerial surveys since the early 1970s to monitor the Steller sea lion population in British Columbia. An updated assessment of Steller Sea Lion abundance, range and population trends that incorporates the most recent survey data is required for implementing a high priority action item identified in the SARA Management Plan for the Steller Sea Lion in Canada.  Additionally, Steller Sea Lions are an important prey species for Transient Killer Whales (TKW) in British Columbia (BC); therefore, current information on the Steller Sea Lion population can be used to meet objectives involving prey availability, identified in the draft amended Recovery Strategy (aRS) (2020) and draft Action Plan (AP) (2020) for TKW. 
Ongoing abundance data, as well as information regarding the numbers and locations of breeding areas may be used by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in making future recommendations regarding the status of the Steller Sea Lion in BC. The assessment may also be used by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in reporting on range-wide population trends in support of post-delisting monitoring of the Eastern population of Steller Sea Lion.

The specific question to be answered by Science is: Based on a systematic assessment of both individual and combined threats (as outlined in the draft amended TKW Recovery Strategy), which threats (or combination of threats) best explain the observed population growth and in turn may have a greater influence on the population trajectories and demographics of TKW into the future?","Discussions occurred in lead up to RSIA 2020/21 review between the SARP TKW Recovery Team and the Pacific Ecosystem Stressors Program (lead: Cathryn Murray) to refine the scope of the study. The Ecosystem Stressors Program is supportive of this project, and has begun work on it.","The SARA draft amended Recovery Strategy (aRS) (2020) and draft Action Plan (AP) (2020) for TKW describe the most pressing anthropogenic threats to TKW: 1) environmental contaminants; and 2) noise and disturbance. As stated in the draft aRS, ‘the extent to which current threats may act synergistically or cumulatively to impact Killer Whales is unknown. In other species, multiple stressors have been shown to have strong negative and often lethal effects, particularly when animals carry elevated levels of environmental contaminants’. A high priority recovery measure (RM7) addressing the question of cumulative impacts on TKW was included in the TKW AP: ‘Assess cumulative effects of potential anthropogenic impacts on Transient Killer Whales using an appropriate impact assessment framework for aquatic species’.  This same RM but for Resident Killer Whales (RKW) was the basis for a study led by the Pacific Ecosystem Stressors Program in 2019, where a cumulative effects assessment (CEA) framework was developed and applied for Northern and Southern Resident Killer Whale populations (NKW and SRKW) (listed as Threatened and Endangered, respectively). Results indicated that the cumulative threats model was a better predictor of observed demographic rates for both populations than individual threats models. Findings of this CEA highlight the importance of considering threats collectively when faced with implementing recovery measures for Killer Whale populations.As stated in the 2019 RKW CEA, ‘the framework [developed for RKW] is a potentially useful tool for managers and scientists… and could also be applied to other populations and species’. A TKW-focused CEA will be useful for SARP recovery planners – as well as to other programs and Departments including (but not limited to) DFO Oceans, DFO Science and Transport Canada - in their efforts towards survival and recovery of TKW specifically, by helping to adaptively inform and/or implement recovery measures. For example, the model could be used to evaluate the impacts of development or other proposals (e.g., commercial pinniped harvest proposals), including possible mitigation and management actions, on the long-term survival and recovery of the population, thereby informing departmental priorities, decisions and actions.Lastly, the development of a CEA specific to TKW will provide an additional ‘pilot’ alongside the RKW CEA, further demonstrating the potential applicability of the model to other marine species in Canada affected by multiple threats.","The draft AP developed for TKW identifies the assessment of the cumulative effects of anthropogenic threats impacting this population as a high priority, to be carried out within a 2-year time frame. Related RMs within the AP are also high priority, including two ongoing/as needed measures RM5 and RM13: ‘Consider the needs of Transient Killer Whales when undertaking management actions that affect prey species (e.g., cull or commercial harvest, issuance of nuisance seal permit applications)’ and ‘Review and assess project impacts on Transient Killer Whales and their habitat, and provide advice on impact avoidance and mitigation measures as required’. If Science advice is not provided, these RMs will not be effectively addressed within the stated time frames, and departmental priority-setting and messaging on why specific management options related to TKW are supported (or not) will be much more challenging. Overall, Killer Whales in Canadian Pacific waters are iconic populations of significant interest at regional, national and international levels, with frequent media coverage of all three ecotypes. Should up-to-date Science advice on TKW not be provided, and management measures informed by Science not be enacted, the Department will likely be subject to public scrutiny and possibly even litigation.","2024-03-31 03:00:00","To date, most research on the threats to Killer Whales (including TKW) has studied threats in isolation, e.g., focusing solely on acoustic disturbance or prey availability.

Preliminary work has been conducted to compare otolith marking to other established techniques (e.g. CWT).  Formal development of a statistically robust and scientifically defensible methodology for thermal marking and assessment of contributions to fisheries and river returns is required to guide implementation of a structured thermal otolith assessment program.

The current assessment framework is based primarily on the use of Coded Wire Tag data to assess enhanced contribution. While this methodology has been peer reviewed and is generally an accurate and precise method, it is costly and implementation has been limited to indicator stocks. Improved information on the ability of thermal otolith marking to reliably estimate enhanced contribution to escapement and fisheries will allow SEP to employ a simple and low-cost alternative method that will allow direct estimation of enhanced contribution. This information will support implementation of various key regional initiatives, including the WSP, the Southern BC Chinook Management Framework, and Marine Stewardship Council certification of WCVI chum fisheries. In addition to broader departmental objectives, this data will be used by SEP to ensure adherence to enhancement guidelines relating to total enhanced contribution. As many of these initiatives are multi-sectoral, the information will have impacts on Fisheries Management and Stock Assessment.","In the absence of peer-reviewed advice on the implementation of a comprehensive thermal otolith marking program, there may be undetected impacts to stocks of natural origin through straying and high proportions of hatchery origin spawners on the spawning grounds.

Enhanced contributions based on CWT’s have been considerably lower than thermal mark-based estimates.  CWT significantly underestimates (by about 50%) the catch and escapement of RCH chinook (45% underestimate in 2016 and 57% underestimate in 2015) compared to thermal mark-based estimates.  Catch along the WCVI was underestimated by 66% and 61% respectively for 2016 and 2015 using CWT-based estimates compared to thermal marked-based estimates.  Escapement of RCH chinook was underestimated by 34% and 55% in 2016 and 2015 respectively.  For swim-ins the CWT underestimated the RCH contribution to the total abundance by on average 31.0% (n=15 years, 1 st dev= 12.5%, range 16%-63% difference).   For the river deadpitch the CWT underestimated the RCH contribution to the total abundance by on average 32.0% (n=15 years, 1 st dev= 14.4%, range 5%-56% underestimate).  

The question from SEP is : Could stock assessment describe sources of discrepancies in CWT-based and thermal marked-based abundance estimates in escapement?  Which estimate is more accurate? SEP applys biostandard survival and exploitation rates for unassessed stocks represented by indicator stocks, such as Robertson Creek Chinook, to calculate operational metrics such as PNI.  Is a PBT methodology the most accurate, if it is able to detect unmarked strays and second generation (eg. ""wild""  definition of WSP) genetic ancestry? What are the pros and cons of each estimation method for estimating PNI?","","Understanding reasons for these differences will allow SEP to prioritize marking programs and methodologies to meet program reporting requirements. 

Further, the PSC is interested in understanding these differences with respect to fishery management. This advice may impact stock assessment and fishery management programs regionally or internationally. Current stock assessment and management models may depend on specific monitoring programs.  For example, annual implementation of the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) relies specifically on data generated from the coast-wide CWT-based Mark Recovery Program.   Therefore, fundamental changes to monitoring programs require broader consideration of the management system.","SEP hatcheries such as Robertson Creek Hatchery expend significant resources to mark and sample to recover marks applied using CWT, thermal and DNA methods, resulting in differing estimates for metrics such as PNI. As the program progresses with hatchery reform within a WSP context, decisions about which estimate is more accurate will be made and questioned.

Regardless of curtailed fisheries of both Sockeye and Chinook, including 2019's significant new fishery management measures to conserve at-risk Fraser Chinook populations, there are concerns and indications that these populations will continue to wane, approaching functional extirpation in many cases.  In addition, the Big Bar landslide, discovered in June, is expected to exacerbate the low escapements of Fraser Chinook Spring 42, Spring 52 and Summer 52 management units in addition to Early Stuart and Early summer Sockeye runs. 

DFO will use the information provided by this request to guide decisions regarding future enhancement activities in the upper Fraser basin, including consideration of program expansion in the form of additional enhancement facilities, and the reallocation of spatial capacity at our current major facilities to support these new priorities.","Multiple First Nations and other stakeholder groups are strongly voicing their concern over the dwindling Chinook and Sockeye escapements in the upper Fraser basin.  There is growing interest amongst both DFO and stakeholders to use hatcheries for conservation purposes.  With significant external funding resources currently available to these groups, the likelihood of new hatchery operations in the upper Fraser within the next 3 to 5 years is high and will likely proceed with or without DFO oversight and support.  New conservation production has the potential to cause more harm than good if it occurs outside the auspices of DFO.  The BC interior Fraser river watershed is comprised of a vast geographical area, with massive salmon production capacity, yet the department owns and operates only one enhancement facility (Spius Creek Hatchery), residing in the Nicola basin and contracts the operation of Shuswap facility located in the Thompson basin.  All of the the production potential at these facilities is already being fully utilized for stocks of conservation concern and/or high priority PST indicator stocks.  

If science advice is not provided, DFO will continue to evaluate production lines through its annual production planning process.

This monitoring should try to answer the question: are there changes to pathogen or sea lice levels in wild salmon that can be linked to the removal of the farms?
This monitoring should consider the following elements:
- What are the fish health parameters that should be measured after marine finfish farms are removed from the area in order to assess potential before and after effects? These must include known pathogens of concern to Pacific salmon in BC (that exist on farms; a minimum of the 9 pathogens included in the previous CSAS risk assessments), as well as sea lice (both Lepeoptheirus salmonis and Caligus clemsensi) at a minimum.

- What salmon stocks can be assessed - e.g. Fraser River, local systems/Broughton rivers? Can impacts be assessed in another way outside these areas, such as by looking at Fraser River stocks when they are returning?
- How long should surveys be performed from time of farm removal? What kind of baseline data should be considered?

The removal of these farms presents an opportunity to monitor potential changes to wild salmon health in the regions of the Broughton Archipelago and the Discovery Islands. Science advice to develop and implement a monitoring program to assess these potential impacts is critical for an accurate assessment.

It is proposed to use a published, quantitative method for cumulative impact mapping developed in 2008 (Halpern et al. 2008) that spatially represents the additive effects of anthropogenic activities and stressors on marine ecosystems. The method uses a spatially-explicit cumulative impact model to relate the footprints of human activities and habitat classes to the potential impact on the ecosystem using vulnerability. This requires three data sources: 1) spatial distribution and intensity of human activities (e.g., fishing, shipping, industrial sites, etc.), 2) spatial distribution of marine habitat classes (e.g., rocky reef, shallow pelagic, eelgrass, etc.), and 3) a matrix of vulnerability scores to quantify the relative impact of each stressor on each habitat class.

The Regulations apply to all aquaculture licence holders, but aquaculture activities for a certain segment of the industry that do not have the same level of risk and/or environmental impact, namely shellfish and land-based fish operators.

Based on available scientific knowledge and information, can threshold be develop as a mean to exclude a certain segment of the aquaculture industry (i.e. shellfish and land-based fish operators) from the Regulations that could be considered low risk of causing ""serious harm"" to fish and fish habitat in regards to the use of deleterious substances ?","","This science advisory process would support the ongoing delivery of DFO's (i.e. Aquaculture management divisions) role as the managing entety of the AAR and the various provisions of the regulation as to ensure the protection of fish and fish habitat.

The purpose of these regulations is to prevent spoilage of catch, minimize the potential for gear loss as well as gear conflict, and minimize bycatch.
What are the impacts of either extending or shortening soak times on the target species?
What are the impacts of either extending or shortening soak times on bycatch species?
To what extent do those impacts vary across fixed gear and trap fisheries?
Do changes in soak time affect potential response to marine mammal or bird entanglements?
Do extended soak times increase the probability of losing gear, thereby increasing ghost gear? Fixed gear and traps may move a considerable distance in 72 hours in certain weather conditions or locations. What is the correlation coefficient between time, distance and the probability of recovering gear?
Do mitigation measures exist that could be adopted to minimize the risks of extending or reducing soak times?
Could Science provide advice on scientific methodologies that would be recommended for determining the lethal and sub-lethal effects of different soak times on the catch?
Could Science provide advice on new fishing gear technologies and how they would potentially impact the frequency of gear tending?",Brittany Beauchamp (Fish Population Science Branch),"Over the years, fishing vessels have increased in size and are fishing further off-shore, making current gear tending regulations impractical. The current gear tending regulatory requirements apply to all gear types, including gillnets, in which catch can potentially spoil if left for too long, as well as traps. A 72-hour or 96-hour gear tending time-frame may not optimize either conservation or operational objectives for a given fishery. It could therefore be beneficial to evaluate appropriate gear tending requirements on a fishery-by-fishery basis. This would allos for fishery specific evaluations of operational requirements and soak time conservation risks, allowing for better tailored management approaches.
DFO is therefore exploring/assessing amendments to these regulations to allow for more flexibility. More specifically, DFO would amend s. 115.2 of the AFR, s. 27 of the MPFR and s. 8 of the NLFR to state that the 72 or 96 hour soak time applies ""unless otherwise specified in the Conditions of Licence"". Licence conditions could be used to lengthen or shorten the soak times on a fishery-by-fishery basis.
Following a potential regulatory amendment, if a fishery wants to modify soak times through conditions of licence, they would have to make a formal request. Upon receipt of the request, a study would be conducted, using guidelines and criteria produced by Science, to determine whether the extension of soak times would have impacts on any of the target species, bycatch, or marine mammals. Based on preliminary discussions and consultations, DFO believes that fixed gear fisheries (lobster, snow crab and red crab traps) would be the fisheries most interested in modifying their soak times through conditions of licence. The Newfoundland Region also mentioned that the deep water Greenland halibut (turbot)in depths >550 meters would have an interest in modifying soak times.
This request relates to the national objective of conserving biodiversity. Through this request, DFO wants to ensure that extending soak times does not pose any conservation risks to marine biodiversity and that sustainability of stocks is maintained. This request also supports the priority of using scientific evidence when making decisions that affect fish stocks.","Withouts Science advice, senior management might determine that the risk level and the uncertainty stemming from these potential regulatory amendments are too high. There is a need for greater clarity regarding the potential impacts of modifying soak times.

If a decision is made to proceed with the regulatory amendments and science advice is not provided, DFO would not be able to rely on pre-established guidelines and criteria that it could use to support the decision to approve or decline requests made by fisheries to modify soak times. This could potentially lead to negative consequences for marine species and their habitat.

Moreover, there my be inconsistencies in approaches across regions and fisheries to assessing requests from fleets for alternative soak times, as well as inefficiencies resulting from a duplication of effort.","2023-03-31 03:00:00",This request was submitted last year.

As part of this approach, other factors (e.g., climate change) can be treated in the narrative, but should not be considered as part of that prioritization exercise. Hence, climate change, while often identified by COSEWIC as a threat to many aquatic species at risk, is not always included in the threat analysis in Recovery Potential Assessments (i.e., the inclusion of climate change varies by region or species and there is no national consistency). For some species, the omission of climate change from the threat analysis could impact recovery feasibility determination and recovery planning for species at risk, including overlooking the identification of new potential introductions of aquatic invasive species as a threat to the recovery.

DFO’s Species at Risk Program is requesting the 2014 guidance be updated to include climate change in the threat analysis for aquatic species at risk predicted to be vulnerable to climate change. To achieve the proper determination of vulnerability to climate change, we are also requesting a determination scheme that would consistently and defensibly determine which species at risk should have an analysis of climate change.",Shannan May-McNally,"Updating this guidance and receiving this advice will provide an opportunity to include climate change as a threat in the threat analysis section of the Recovery Potential Assessment for appropriate species. Recovery Potential Assessments are key fundamental documents that guide Species at Risk Act (SARA) listing decisions and recovery planning. As the Recovery Potential Assessment guides recovery planning, it will influence the determination of recovery measures and will have implications for other DFO sectors/programs supporting implementation of the SARA. The outcome of this request will include updated national guidance, hence impacting other DFO programs (Science) and all regions.","While there are challenges associated with analyzing climate change as a threat for all aquatic species at risk, experience has shown that the lack of this analysis and the resultant information could have dramatic impact on a recovery feasibility determination for a species. For a specific example, the recovery feasibility determination for the Atlantic Mud-Piddock may be impacted by whether beach erosion caused by severe storms, linked to climate change, results in loss of habitat and is properly considered as a factor in the recovery feasibility determination. 

Without the option or guidance to assess the impact of climate change for certain species, regions may not include climate change in threat analyses or may do so in an inconsistent manner. In certain cases, this could result in an incorrect determination of recovery feasibility for a species and could impact the direction taken in recovery planning, which could impact species, habitats, and ecosystems at various scales. This may further impact DFO's ability to meet its SARA mandate and influence utilization of resources.","2023-03-31 03:00:00","Globally, climate change has been accepted as urgent issue affecting the environment, including conservation of biodiversity.

Advice provided on suitable indicators of 'state' and methods for defining / determining state will be used to develop an approach to understanding and reporting on the state of fish and fish habitat across the country. This will be used to develop these area based reports. In addition, advice provided will also be used to support integrated planning efforts, identifying sensitive habitat, and reporting to parliament on program success.","FFHPP requires this advice to support the area based reports it committed to in the 2018 Treasury Board submission.

Recovery strategies for many GLSLRB species describe the utility of captive breeding and associated activities (e.g., translocations) for improving the survival and recovery of SARA listed freshwater species; however, uncertainty exists around when and in which scenarios these measures could be considered and applied as a recovery tool. 

The goal of this request is to evaluate key considerations for when and how captive breeding and/or translocations (within populations or designatable units, consistent with COSEWIC's guidelines on manipulated populations) can improve survival and recovery of freshwater SARA species (i.e. fishes and mussels), and to identify potential risks associated with application of these tools. 

The advice provided will be used by the Species at Risk Program (SARP) to help understand key scientific considerations around captive breeding and translocations as a recovery tool.  The work will also benefit all regional SARPs considering introductions as a recovery measure for freshwater species at risk.  More specifically, as an example, this advice will assist the SARP when evaluating stocking proposals received from applicants and academics as part of contribution programs that promote the recovery of aquatic species at risk such as the Canada Nature Fund or the Habitat Stewardship Program.","If the advice is not completed, the SARP may lack the appropriate information to initiate or promote such approaches to recovery in the short term.  If these types of projects are proposed by other agencies or proponents, the SARP will then need to use the best available information, including expert judgment, for permitting decisions around captive breeding and species translocations.  There is a risk that key information needs will be overlooked, potentially leading to ineffective captive breeding and/or translocations or unreasonable harm to source populations. Broader risks include failing to effectively recover populations for which captive breeding and/or translocations are deemed the only opportunity to meet recovery targets and whether such efforts pose risks to other species and the ecosystem at large.
Last year, several contribution program proposals were received from applicants, including academics seeking to undertake and validate stocking or translocation of aquatic of species at risk.

Science advice is required to provide a nationally consistent basis and evidence to support the selection of limit reference points. Although avoiding serious harm is cited as the basis for biologically based limits, practical experience shows that it is difficult to uniquely define states of serious harm until they become quite severe, which is precisely the problem to be avoided.  Typically reference points are based on equilibrium conditions related to maximum sustainable yield, or so-called historical reference points that represent undesirable (limits) or desirable (targets) historical states of a stock.

Under the Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program (FFHPP) regulatory review process, this particular management measure is one of 28 standardized measures that may be considered for avoiding and mitigating impacts to fish and fish habitat. Timing Windows are often prescribed for use in conjunction with other measures.
Timing Windows may vary by province, species and watercourse. The  DFO website (https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/pnw-ppe/timing-periodes/index-eng.html) provides a list of tabs per territory and province, with specific instructions for each of them. Their presentation is not homogenous, and for freshwater they are often linked to provincially defined windows.
Considering the importance that Timing Windows play in the avoidance and mitigation of impacts on fish and fish habitat,(a)their establishment should be supported and informed by scientific advice,and (b)their effectiveness should be monitored, and updated over time to take into account changes occurring on the landscape that may alter their effectiveness(e.g. climate change).
There are several important questions to consider with respect to timing windows, and it may be necessary to break these out into separate but linked investigations in a staged approach. 
Is there evidence to support that Timing Windows are an effective management measure for avoiding impacts to fish and fish habitat? 
What would constitute a clear, nation-wide, scientifically defensible rationale/framework that could be used for both verifying effectiveness of existing timing windows, and establishing new ones at a regional/sub-regional level?* 
What important gaps currently exist from a geographic or watercourse perspective for timing windows nation-wide,and how should these gaps be prioritized for future science advice?
*Advice on how to validate current windows will need to take into account the fact that in many cases DFO will be working with other resource managers such as the Province or Indigenous Communities who have established windows or will be working with DFO to do so. This may involve consideration of how/if different approaches can meet established objectives.","Karin Ponader, Keith Clarke","FFHPP is currently developing numerous tools under the fish and fish habitat protection provisions of the new Fisheries Act.

Specifically, DFO AMD Pacific Region would like Science to quantitatively determine the what the relative contribution of sea lice (both Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus spp.) “spill back” from Atlantic salmon farms is to the sea lice burden observed in wild out-migrating juvenile Pacific salmon. The analysis should determine what statistical strength of association (if any) in prevalence and/or abundance exists temporally and spatially between the sea lice infestations in farmed and wild populations. The analysis should control for non-farm effects such as: time at sea, environmental conditions, and influence of wild reservoirs of sea lice. Any determination of a threshold effect wherein if farm infestation pressure is below a given amount “spill back” is limited or does not appear to occur, would be a key finding. It is anticipated that science will work with the client to develop the problem formulation statement and refine the peer review question(s) so the above question represents a placeholder issue/objective.

It is further anticipated that this process may be broken into two assessments (one West Coast and one East Coast) based on geographic, oceanographic, and biological differences between coasts.

It is expected that the following knowledge will be required to answer the broad question:
• How to quantify degree of juvenile wild salmon exposure to fish farms prior to sampling event. 
  o This requires knowledge of species and region specific outmigration patterns and behavior.
• Environmental data on temperature and salinity to consider sea lice development time post-exposure.
• Knowledge of “back ground” sea lice infestation pressure from wild reservoirs to provide baseline of sea lice infestation for a given species and region.","Jay Parsons (NCR,ABAAHSB)","Sea lice infestations on aquaculture sites represent an ongoing challenge to growers and regulatory managers in terms of managing infestations on-site, among farms within local areas , and addressing the potential for infestations on the farm and potential impacts therefrom to negatively affect wild fish populations at various geographic scales. It is anticipated that the West Coast process will be addressed first. The assessment and peer review will assess the  results from a risk assessment of this hazard including the possible hydrologic linkages and connectivity among aquaculture sites that may be part of the parasite infestation in and among sites as well as the potential for fallowing to be used to mitigate sea lice infestation. There is a great deal of scientific knowledge and data regarding sea lice infestations. This advice is needed to inform development and application of effective adaptive management approaches to address both real and perceived interactions between aquaculture and the environment.

There are other DFO sectors on the Introductions and Transfers  Committee that would use this science-based evidence to support their risk assessment of the potential movement.

The Whale Sanctuary Project is a not-for-profit that has applied for a lease to establish a seaside sanctuary in Port Hilford (Wine Harbour), Guysborough where previously captive beluga and/or orcas can be rehabilitated or can live permanently in an environment that is said to maximize well-being and autonomy and is a close as possible to natural habitat. 
In winter 2020, when the preferred location of Port Hilford was released by the proponent, our Minister received a letter from the Minister of the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries & Aquaculture on the proposed sanctuary, its upcoming assessment and our potential collaboration on the project. 

In April 2021, the Nova Scotia Department of Lands and Forestry received a formal development proposal on the establishment of a whale sanctuary. The Province is actively working on two leases for the proponent, which include a partial shore-based component and a significantly larger water lot.

It is expected that a DFO assessment will soon be requested. The establishment of a whale sanctuary and the introduction of cetaceans will require significant and specific scientific input from various sectors within the Department, as well as other federal departments and agencies, as per our mandate. At a minimum, DFO’s Introductions and Transfers (I&T) process (Section 56 licence) will need to consider the implications of moving live cetaceans from ecological, genetic and disease perspectives.

Some questions that have previously been discussed are as follows:
What are the potential threats/impacts of such an activity to conspecifics in the area?

Disease:
What is the likelihood of a disease transfer between captive animals and animals in wild populations?
How are any disease/pathogens in captive animals documented and tracked?
Have captive animals been in contact with terrestrial animals that may introduce novel diseases into a wild population?
Do captive animals have any diseases that may put wild populations at risk?
How can such risks be reduced/eliminated prior to transfer to sea pens?

Genetics:
Is there a risk of genetic transfer from captive to wild populations, if animals escape?
Where are captive animals from?
Is there a risk that escaped animals could potentially mate with wild populations?
What would be the genetic consequences of this?","There are a series of expected/potential consequences. Without the available science information, there may be a  significant delay to the Introduction and transfer of any cetaceans while that appropriate knowledge, expertise and science-evidence is generated, which could potentially not be in the welfare of the cetacean(s). It is possible that the required expertise does not exist within the Department resulting in long delays to any release decision.

Science advice is required to (1) evaluate the potential impacts of proposed revisions/clarifications to the PA Policy, particularly in taking into account diverse stock life histories and the availability of data, (2) advise on international practices for establishing default reference points (where ""default"" means recommended in the absence of stock-specific choices)that appropriately represent the values inherent in fisheries management objectives, and typical levels of probability (also called risk tolerance) that other jurisdictions associate with achieving or avoiding those points, and (3) simulation-test the ability of new or revised default harvest control rules to achieve policy intent while taking into account uncertainties.","Julie Marentette, Senior Science Advisor, Fish Population Science","Recent CSAS National Advisory Processes [NAPs] (i.e., January 2020 process to support development of rebuilding guidelines, and the May/June 2020 process on precautionary approach harvest strategies), as well as an earlier NAP in 2012 (Technical Guidelines for implementing the PA) have highlighted existing challenges in producing Science advice and providing recommendations to fisheries management using the 2009 version of the PA Policy. This policy will be used as the framework to interpret and implement the new Fish Stocks provisions in the amended Fisheries Act, so it is also important that the Policy language more closely aligns with that of the legislation and associated regulations. The requested Science advice is required to ensure the PA Policy applies current international best practices, functions as intended, and is interpreted in a nationally consistent manner across a wide variety of stocks. This will support DFO in meeting its new legislative requirements and further its mandate to sustainably manage fisheries.","Implementation of the Fish Stocks provisions is expected to result in greater public scrutiny for fisheries management decisions for prescribed major stocks. In particular, these decisions will, for the first time, be subject to judicial review. Improvements to the PA Policy, and thus how DFO implements the Fish Stocks provisions is recommended to ensure decisions are defensible.
Absence of science advice on potential updates to the PA Policy may mean that the updates do not achieve the desired outcomes namely: (1) that the policy is reflective of international best practices, (2) that the default reference points and harvest control rules achieve policy intent, and (3) that the policy can be implemented in a nationally consistent manner.","2025-03-31 03:00:00","The Fish Stocks provisions are targeted to come into effect by the end of fiscal 2020-21 for the first group of stocks, and the majority of Canada's major stocks will be made subject to these provisions by the end of fiscal 2023-24.

There is a proposed gold mine project with the St. Mary's River watershed in the vicinity of Melrose, Guysborough County, Nova Scotia. Preliminary plans for the proposed project involve the release of mine effluent into St. Mary's River via McKeen Brook and/or Archibald Lake. The Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program (the Program) is interested in any existing scientific information about Atlantic Salmon life history and habitat use in the St. Mary's River watershed that will inform the Department's assessment of potential environmental effects of the proposed project to this endangered species. One of the Research Documents prepared for the Recovery Potential Assessment for Southern Upland Atlantic Salmon refers to an acoustic tagging study of kelts in St. Mary's River in Section 1.1, page of the document as follows: 

""There is very limited information about the overwintering behaviour of kelts in the Southern Upland. In a recent acoustic tagging study in the St. Mary’s River, no kelts were observed leaving the river immediately after spawning in 2010, and 24 tagged fish were observed leaving the river in the spring of 2011 (Gibson and Halfyard, unpublished data). The earliest observation of a salmon leaving the river was March 16th, but most salmon exited the river between April 22nd and May 11th. This suggests that the proportion of adults remaining in Southern Upland rivers after spawning to overwinter in fresh water is high (up to 100%), particularly in rivers with suitable overwintering habitat.""

It is the Program's understanding that this dataset includes information about the location(s) and timing of potentially important staging and overwintering habitat for Atlantic Salmon spawners and kelts. This information would be important to consider in the Program's assessment of the potential environmental effects of the proposed works, undertakings, and activities associated with the proposed gold mine project on Southern Upland Atlantic Salmon in St. Mary's River. The specific questions the Program has about this dataset are:

1. What was the study design and methods used in the acoustic tagging study?
2. What information about habitat use by Atlantic Salmon in St. Mary's River does the study provide?
3. Are there specific locations of potential staging and/or overwintering habitat that can be identified by the dataset? Where are these locations? 
4. Are there specific temporal periods of habitat use by Atlantic Salmon that can be identified from the dataset? What are these temporal periods?
5. What proportion of Atlantic Salmon in St. Mary's River are using these habitats?",My understanding of the dataset comes from brief discussions with Dustin Raab and Jamie Gibson. I have previously discussed with Tara McIntyre.,"This information would be important to consider in the Program's assessment of the potential environmental effects of the proposed works, undertakings, and activities associated with the proposed gold mine project on Southern Upland Atlantic Salmon in St. Mary's River. This information will be shared with the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada as part of the federal environmental assessment for the proposed gold mine project.","The consequences are that the environmental assessment and regulatory review of potential effects to Southern Upland Atlantic Salmon from the proposed gold mine project will not be informed by the best available scientific and technical information. As a result, there will be greater uncertainty about the potential adverse effects to fish and fish habitat, avoidance and mitigations measures, and regulatory decisions.","2022-12-31 04:00:00",The timeline for the federal environmental assessment of the proposed gold mine project is uncertain but it may commence in 2022.

This work includes establishing new MPAs and other effective conservation measures (OECMs) - such as Marine Refuges under the Fisheries Act - through the development of bioregional conservation networks. Most recently, a commitment was made to protect 25% of Canada's oceans by 2025, working toward 30% by 2030. Progress has been made on establishing new MPAs and OECMs but very few of these sites are regularly monitored for their effectiveness. The need to quantify the conservation benefits of new MPAs and OECMs, as well as to increase the effectiveness of existing sites, is now widely recognized. Recent international and emerging national guidance on OECMs highlights the need for monitoring within all sites. This Science advisory process would inform the development of a two-tiered monitoring plan for the bioregional network and individual sites, such as WEBCA. WEBCA is the oldest and largest component of the bioregional conservation network so it is overdue to for a monitoring plan.

Risk assessments of aquatic invasive species (AIS) are required to make sound management decisions regarding the aquatic ecosystems, fisheries resources, fish habitat, and aquaculture that AIS may impact, and that Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is mandated to protect. The current request can follow the ``National Detailed-Level Risk Assessment Guidelines: Assessing the Biological Risk of Aquatic Invasive Species in Canada`` (Res Doc 2011/092).  
This risk assessments framework for AIS includes information on species biology (Biological Synopis), pathways and vectors and potential risk to Canada aquatic ecosystems (Risk Characterization). Gulf AIS-NCP is currently looking to contract out and produce a  Biological synopsis for Black Crappie(Pomoxis nigcomaculatus) which could be validated and adopted for this risk assessment by Science.","NA 

AIS-NCP Gulf had an informal discussion with the Gulf CSAS coordinator and the acting division manager of Fisheries and Ecosystems Science Gulf Region on October 26 to briefly discuss the submission process and the validity in submit the request under a CSAS process.","Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has a legal responsibility to protect aquatic ecosystems through the Fisheries Act and, more specifically from AIS through the Aquatic Invasive Species Regulations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are one of the biggest threats to natural ecosystems and biological diversity, and often have a significant negative socio-economic impact. Once established in a new ecosystem, AIS has the potential to become predators, competitors or parasites of native species or can alter habitat making it less suitable for native species. Once established, it becomes very difficult and sometimes impossible to eradicate AIS, leading to often unpredictable, recurring management costs.  Responding to detections of AIS as quickly as possible can greatly reduce their chance of establishing and spreading. 
Black Crappie has been reported to cause salmon declines in rivers of northwest USA and also reduce populations of endemic and native prey species, including invertebrates and fish.
The identification of biological risk level of Black Crappie in NB will guide the appropriate response level and actions to undertake, and it will provide a better understand of the expected ecological and socio-economic impacts. 
The information/advice resulting from this CSAS will provide AIS-NCP (Gulf Region) and potentially the national program with adequate insight to allow sound science-based management decisions for adequate response in case Black Crappie is introduced and or migrates into waterways, waterbodies where they are non-indigenous and not present yet. This risk assessment will be also valuable for Nova Scotia and PEI as well. Therefore, the end users will be AIS-NCP Gulf and potentially MAR region as well.       
Note that, a good portion of the Saint John River Watershed and some other waterways in New Brunswick are within administrative boundaries for DFO Maritimes (i.e. Science, Fisheries Management, Species at Risk). This request might need to be discussed between Gulf and Mar EOS Branch.","If science advice is not provided, the AIS-NCP would rely on some information already available in the literature, which might not include all aspects of a risk assessment and it would not have the same value than a CSAS risk assessment when used to define the actions, engaging with partners and providing recommendations to senior management.

Without the biological risk assessment it makes difficult to identify and evaluate effectively the best options to manage the Black Crappie introduction and spread in NB and in the Maritimes. The risk assessment is an essential piece to complete the risk management and develop and implement recommendations on how to manage the species.","2022-06-30 03:00:00","Responding to non-native species invasion is very time sensitive. Short-term containment measures are being currently explored and soon implemented. On the other hand, the long-term management actions for Black Crappie will need to consider the biological risk assessment as well as the risk management. Once a species has established it becomes more difficult and costly to manage. The risk assessment will provide the scientific support necessary to move forward with decisions related to the recommendations or implementation of long-term actions, which should start to be discussed with partners in earlier spring 2022 and implemented as soon as 2022 field season. The AIS-NCP intention is to start engaging with partners earlier spring to discuss potential options to manage the situation in Big Lake, and this Science advice can provide a more comprehensive context in terms of risks and the level of effort required to address those risks.",0,"",1,"Black crappie is non-native in New Brunswick Waterways and currently seems confined to this one 3.4 hectare lake in the Nackawick stream watershed, Big Lake.  Big Lake is currently the only place in NB where Black Crappie is known to be present. Fishing efforts conducted by AIS-NCP Gulf at Big Lake in June 2021 yielded capture of over 300 Black Crappie of different size classes which would suggest they have reproduced and are relatively comfortable in that environment. A preliminary literature review on the biology of Black Crappie seems to suggest that the species would likely establish, reproduce and strive in some of the waterbodies in New Brunswick.  The characterization of risk will be important to define the management measures under the four pillars of AIS (prevention, early detection, response and control management) and the level of effort required to prevent migration/spreading of Black Crappie further downstream from Big Lake into the Nackawick Stream watershed.",70,"2021-11-10 19:44:28.134001",,2091,2091,122,2091,,,2023,2022,1

This is a social science research project on the Human dimensions of the lobster fishery and the EBM framework and social science methods may be pertinent to other regions.","The objectives of this review are: 
Are the methodological approaches used to conduct this research appropriate? 

Which social, cultural and economic objectives require further investigation? 

What type of social science and humanities research is required within DFO to meet these objectives?","DFO science staff, Adam Cook, Research Scientist.","Lobster/Jakej/Sak is the driving force of the regional fishing economy and has significant social and cultural value for Indigenous and coastal communities throughout the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Maritimes Region (Wiber & Milley 2007; Spanier et al 2015; Barnett 2018; Coates 2019; Mombourquette 2019; Greenan et al. 2019). The Maritimes Region and the Scotia Fundy Fisheries Management Sector (DFO 2018) is based on federally established boundaries and regulations and may not reflect the geographical space, historical significance or traditional territory accepted and practiced by the Mi’kmaq, Wolastoqey, and Peskotomuhkati Peoples throughout the Maritimes Region.  

Studies have revealed that the lobster/jagej/sak fishery in the Maritimes Region is being challenged by both environmental and anthropogenic factors. Research examining the impact of climate change on lobster/jagej/sak and lobster/jagej/sak dependent communities suggest they are at risk of becoming vulnerable due to increased water temperatures, ocean acidification, changes in distribution of the species, rising sea levels, and major weather events (Le Bris et al 2018; Greenan et al 2019; Wilson et al 2020). Research also indicates that there have been changes in fishing patterns and practices over time.  (Barnett & Eakin 2015; Barnett et al 2017; Barnett 2018). These shifts have resulted in increased fishing effort and/or fishing efficiency which result in higher total landings independent of the changes in population biomass. Despite higher landings and increased earning potential, individuals and Indigenous and coastal communities reliant on the fishery have experienced a variety of negative economic, social, cultural, and institutional outcomes (Kearney 1989; McMullan et al 1993; Charles 1997; Wiber and Kennedy 2001; Bodiguel 2002; Fogarty 2005; Wiber & Milley 2007; Barnett and Eakin 2015; Barnett et al 2017; Barnett 2018;  Mombourquette 2019).  

While these outcomes impact individuals and communities reliant on the lobster/jagej/sak fishery in the Maritimes Region, the human dimensions have not been systematically and explicitly examined and accounted for in fisheries assessments. As a result, a broad spectrum of social, cultural, economic and institutional aspects have not been adequately integrated into science assessments (Long et al 2015; Stephenson et al 2018; 2019; Foley et al 2020). However, Sections 2.5 and 6.3 of the Modernized Fisheries Act (R.S.C., 1985, c.F-14) place greater emphasis on the human dimensions of fisheries. Furthermore, the fish Stock Provisions of the modernized Fisheries Act indicates that if the Minister decides to invoke exceptions in managing major fish stocks due to adverse cultural or socio-economic impacts, that such decisions will be published (DFO 2020). Cultural and socio-economic information will thus be considered part of evidence for how DFO will be able to meet the obligations of these provisions (DFO 2019). In order to respond to these new considerations in science and decision-making processes, social science and humanities methods and data are required.   

The purpose of this study is to explore the human dimensions of the lobster/jagej/sak fishery in the Maritimes Region through the lens of Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM). EBM is broadly understood as an interdisciplinary method that balances ecological, social, cultural, economic, and governance principles at appropriate temporal and spatial scales in a distinct geographic area in order to achieve sustainable resource use (Daly et al. 2020: 1; Gavaris 2009; Long et al. 2015). More specifically, the intent of this research is to understand social, cultural and a broader suite of economic objectives (i.e. goals, needs and values) for the lobster/jagej/sak  fishery. Combining objectives into a framework means moving towards comprehensive science assessments of the lobster/jagej/sak fishery, and science advice that enables decision-makers to compare trade-offs in outcomes that result from alternative management options (DFO 2020:9). This study uses principles, methods and practices drawn from the social sciences and humanities. It relies on the best available data on human dimensions of the Indigenous and commercial lobster/jagej/sak fisheries in the Maritimes Region.","The department will not have the necessary information to fully implement sections 2.5 and 6.3 of the modernized Fisheries Act in the context of the Maritimes Region lobster fishery, which allows the minister to consider social, cultural and economic factors in their decision-making process.","2023-03-01 04:00:00",The contracts of the lead investigator and co-investigator on the project expire in March of 2023.,0,"",1,"The advice currently provided by science on conservation and sustainability does not include a full evaluation of the risk to communities and support in maintaining healthy and prosperous communities, as outlined in our departmental mandate.

Shellfish transfers for aquaculture is an important vector of introduction of aquatic invasive species in marine ecosystems.

Mitigation measures (AIS control treatments) are used as a condition of license for DFO approved Introduction and Transfer permits. Annually, the AIS National Core Program has provides input on nearly 200 letters of advice related to aquaculture. However, there are no national DFO guidelines for proposed mitigation measures used to treat aquaculture shellfish and macroalgae product to reduce the risk of introduction and spread of AIS.

To date, a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of mitigation treatments used on marine AIS and their effects on survival of cultured species has not been conducted. The need for a fulsome review is compounded by the fact that a wide variety of methods are endorsed and used by different jurisdictions or organizations without national consistency.

The Aquatic Invasive Species National Core Program intends to develop guidance for reducing the risk of spreading AIS in aquaculture. This would provide nationally-consistent operational guidance to DFO Introduction and Transfer (I&T) committees in issuing conditions of licenses and to aquaculture farmers, with regards to Canadian AIS mitigation for shellfish and macroalgal species that may be vectors of AIS. Other end user(s) would be Provincial ministries to use the national consistent guidance to inform their provincial legislation.

Ideally the guide and advice would apply to all introductions and transfers of shellfish and macroalgae. Priority should be given to movements or transfers in the context of issuing conditions of licenses. Followed by movements or transfers to processing plants. Supplementary advice that applies to International transfers, movements or transfers related to Relay fisheries and any other movements or transfers would be beneficial.","There will be no national consistency on advice for mitigating AIS spread through aquaculture introductions and transfers to guide federal/provincial management decision making. Aquaculture farmers may not have the appropriate advice on how to combat AIS and prevent their spread through aquaculture-mediated introductions and transfers. This may lead to further spread of AIS and impacts on commercial viability, social acceptability of the industry, and marine ecosystem sustainability. Although some regions already have conditions for introductions and transfers, regional harmonization and advice on the best available methods are essential to minimize the risk of spread and subsequent impacts.","2023-03-31 03:00:00","Currently, AIS National Core Program is providing advice to Aquaculture nearly 200 times a year, with demand increasing.

These fish can reproduce asexually through gynogenesis, which is a reproductive process that exploits the sperm of other fish species in the water column to activate egg development and gives rise to new females which are clones. This reproductive interference can cause adverse effects to native fish species.

Prussian Carp is an extremely hardy species that can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. This species has been found in aquatic environments with low oxygen and poor water quality, which are often unsuitable for native fish species. It is also generalist in terms of  habitat and feeding, which can outcompete native species for food and habitat. These characteristics make it highly successful invader, threatening the ecological integrity of Canadian aquatic ecosystems.

Prussian Carp is currently only found in Alberta and Saskatchewan in North America. (https://www.invasivespeciescentre.ca/invasive-species/meet-the-species/fish-and-invertebrates/prussian-carp/ )

Prussian Carp is not listed in the Aquatic Invasive Species Regulations; however, the Regulations enables DFO and certain provinces and territories to prevent introductions and to treat and destroy Prussian Carp as a non-indigenous species. Given the limited resources of the Aquatic Invasive Species National Core Program, the program needs to understand the biological risks associated with this species before further investing in prevention efforts, responses and control of Prussian Carp compared with other invasive species. 

A national screening level risk assessment would provide DFO, provinces and territories the information needed to determine if Prussian Carp represents a relatively high risk to Canadian ecosystems and help prioritize efforts and resources to prevent its spread. In addition, the result of a national screening level biological risk assessment would help DFO determine the need for a subsequent detailed biological risk assessment and or consider adding the species to the Aquatic Invasive Species Regulations. Adding a species to the regulations provides more regulatory tools to manage that species, and can specify a region of Canada to which it applies.

Goldfish are often illegally released by people who no longer want them. 
Occurrences of goldfish populations surviving in the wild across Canada (Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick, P.E.I), has had recent media attention. 

These fish are able to tolerate fluctuations in water temperature and water with low levels of dissolved oxygen. They feed mainly on fish eggs, larvae and aquatic plants. In healthy ecosystems, goldfish don’t appear to compete well with some native fish. However, they seem to tolerate poor water quality, which may give them a competitive advantage in degraded systems.

The ecology and impacts of Goldfish introduced to North America’s waters have not been widely studied. However, the behaviour of Ontario populations indicates they may reduce the province’s biodiversity through their effects on native species.

-	Goldfish eat snails, small insects, fish eggs, and juvenile fish, making this species a competitor with, and predator of, native fish.
-	They stir up mud and other matter when they feed, which increases the cloudiness of the water and affects the growth of aquatic plants.
-	They have the potential to produce large populations in some situations, especially in stagnant waters with few predators.
-	Goldfish can carry diseases, such as the Koi herpesvirus that can harm local fish populations.

There is a proposed open pit gold mine in the vicinity of Melrose, Guysborough County, NS.  The project is located within the St. Mary’s River watershed. The St. Mary's River mainstem is located approximately 1-2 km to the southwest of the project area, which is approximately 14 km upstream of Sherbrooke and 4 km downstream of Glenelg Lake. McKeen Brook, Cargill Lake, and Archibald Lake are located within the project area. All of these waterbodies provide habitat for many species of freshwater and anadromous fish including: Southern Upland Atlantic Salmon, Brook Trout, American Eel, Alewife, Shad, and Smelt. 

Based on the Project Description, all watercourses downstream of the mine have potential to be adversely affected by the project.  The proponent is proposing to release treated water from the Tailings Management Facility as well as surface water runoff and stockpile seepage with suspended sediment into Archibald Lake and/or a location within the McKeen Brook system. Hydrological alterations to various watercourses, including McKeen Brook, are likely from site infrastructure and project activities.  A substantial quantity of water will be withdrawn from either Archibald Lake or the St. Mary's River mainstem for TMF start up, and then daily during the 6  year operational period of the mine. Numerous tributaries to McKeen Brook will be overprinted by site infrastructure. 

To support the Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program's (FFHPP) advice to the Impact Assessment Agency during the environmental assessment, FFHPP is requesting a summary of existing scientific information about fish and fish habitat in the vicinity of the Project (i.e., St. Mary's River - East Branch and mainstem), and a scientific review of the information provided by the proponent on effects to fish and fish habitat in the Project's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). FFHPP has reviewed existing DFO Science documents on SU Atlantic Salmon and is looking for project-specific advice and location-specific information not available in these documents. Key questions:

1. What is current population status relative to available historic data of key fish populations - including SU Atlantic Salmon, Brook Trout, American Eel, Alewife - in the St. Mary's River system? In McKeen Brook and Archibald Lake?
2. What are the main habitat functions and features that affected habitats provide for key fish populations (i.e., spawning, feeding, rearing, overwintering, etc.)?
3. Is the proponent's characterization of adverse effects to fish and fish habitat from the Project supported by the information provided in the EIS?
4. Based on the information provided in the EIS, what is the likelihood that the Project will result in population level effects to key fish species in the St. Mary's River, particularly SU Atlantic Salmon? 
5. What follow up monitoring programs should be implemented to verify the effect predictions?",I have discussed this request at a high-level with Tara McIntyre and Dustin Raab.,"Under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012), DFO must provide expert advice and existing information to the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada (the Agency) as part of the project's EA. The Agency will use DFO's advice to characterize the adverse effects to fish and fish habitat from the Project and to determine whether the Project is likely to result in significant adverse environmental effects on fish and fish habitat and aquatic species at risk.  The advice will also be used by FFHPP to inform regulatory decisions under the Fisheries Act and the Species at Risk Act (should a decision be made to list SU Atlantic Salmon or American Eel under SARA).","As proposed, the Project will result in adverse effects to fish and fish habitat in the St. Mary's River, including SU Atlantic Salmon and American Eel which have been assessed as Endangered and Threatened, respectively, by COSEWIC and are currently under consideration for listing under SARA.  The public and stakeholders including the Atlantic Salmon Federation, NS Salmon Association, and St. Mary's River Association have raised concerns about the Project's potential to affect salmon.

Peter Lawton – DFO Science - Coastal Ecosystem Science Division","The American Lobster fishery in the Maritimes Region is currently faced with increased fishing, social, and environmental pressures. There is a growing need to acquire fisheries independent data that can fill gaps in nearshore areas inaccessible by typical survey methods (Cook et al. 2020). The primary fisheries independent data source (inshore trawl survey) which supports stock assessments in LFA 34-36 is limited by depth and bottom type and is expensive to operate. SCUBA transect surveys collect data on benthic habitat classification (I.e., substrate type and macrophyte id), lobster size frequencies, sex ratio, egg stage, clutch size, shell condition, egg presence, along with temperature and depth profiles and are easily conducted and replicated throughout the region. Unlike trap surveys, SCUBA transects are less impacted by factors such as catchability of lobster, and limitations on the size of lobster sampled by the trap. SCUBA surveys provide full size spectrum of lobster from recently settled juveniles to large lobster too big to enter a trap, and the ability to sample lobster through all life stages regardless of shell condition and in turn collecting information on moult cycle. Similar data from transect surveys are incorporated in other region’s stock assessments to strengthen estimates of abundance and densities of berried females and new recruits (Comeau et al. 2008, Rondeau et al. 2014).
 
Historically, there were significant dive survey programs within the Maritimes Region, with the distinction that transect surveys were not formally incorporated into the stock assessment. Primary regional management drivers for coastal habitat surveys for lobsters were coastal aquaculture development. For studies conducted from 1989 onwards there are regional databases that can be accessed to support the review. In addition to the collection of new data this project will also digitally archive and analyze SCUBA transect data collected in the early 1980s that was previously unpublished (Grand Manan, NB and McNutts Island, NS). Replication of these sites were also completed for a historical comparison of lobster abundance and habitat use.  
 
As an example of current regional science underway with similar objectives, an academic project at the University of New Brunswick has recently (2019-2021) reoccupied SCUBA transects in Maces Bay, NB, previously surveyed by DFO in the early 1990’s and early 2000’s (project collaboration between Rochette, UNB, and Lawton, DFO).
In 2021 sites around Grand Manan were added to the project to replicate a study conducted from 1989 to 2015. The primary focus of historic dive surveys in Grand Manan was Flagg Cove, a site known to the industry and DFO Science as an extremely important area for seasonal aggregation of large-berried females. Flagg Cove and Whale Cove were identified as an EBSA (ecologically and biologically significant area) based on the uniqueness, species abundance and abundance with fitness consequences for lobsters (Buzeta 2013). Large-berried females are known to migrate into shallow waters (5 – 20 m) in these coves, using the locations for both larval release (females with late-stage eggs) and egg development (females with early-stage egg) before moving further offshore to deeper waters in the fall. During the 2021 field season transects from previous research were replicated in Flagg Cove and surprisingly found no berried females, and little to no sign of their presence from earlier in the 2021 summer - characteristic circular excavated depressions in the mud/sand substrate common in the area. To address questions and concerns from industry, dive data (historic and recent) will be paired with historical seabed video databases and regional coastal habitat mapping to better understand shifts in the large lobster aggregations.
 
The expansion of the dive transect survey has been possible through valuable collaboration with fishing associations where their time and boat access has been provided in kind. These partnerships come with the expectation of published reports on how lobster habitat use has changed and what shifts are occurring in local inshore populations. This project provides and update to historic studies and baselines to sites that have not been previously sampled.","A current proposed regional science project activity planned in FY2022-23 and beyond is based on generally-recognized utility of SCUBA and seabed video survey approaches for coastal lobster habitat inventory that comes from prior research and science advisory work across multiple jurisdictions (e.g., DFO regions, US state fishery agencies, Canadian & US academic programs).
 
However, in the context of Maritimes Region lobster stock assessment programming, as well as other significant regional ocean management issues, such as aquaculture site referrals, and work towards bio-regional marine conservation targets, it is appropriate to conduct a cost-benefit assessment of these scientific survey approaches and document their contemporary utility.
 
**If science advice is not provided, consequences would include:** 
 
-  Continued void of data in nearshore, poor understanding of lobster habitat use. 

-  Concerns from industry on shifts in sensitive lobster aggregations continue to be unaddressed.

The outcomes (i.e., how to streamline these siting processes) may be applicable to shellfish and freshwater aquaculture operations.","CSAS submissions to provide advice for siting requests are regular occurrences (e.g., Newfoundland and Labrador region has submitted them annually since 2018), and there are often multiple requests each year (e.g., the 2019 request from NL sought advice on 13 separate sites). The CSAS process for siting requests is well-established and much information is gathered by regional DFO personnel to support it.

Are there aspects or components of the process, or some degree of pre-analysis in certain aspects, which can be automated (e.g., a decision tree, which may indicate that a certain issue is not of concern) or done by DFO Aquaculture Management personnel to streamline the work that is done during the CSAS meetings, so that only those parts that need new advice are discussed at the meeting itself. Additionally, is a new CSAS process for advice required when lease changes are minimal? Can previous CSAS advice be used?","Brief discussions with Lisa Setterington, but nothing in depth.","Regional staff prepare documentation and gather supporting evidence in preparation for CSAS meetings where they are used to provide advice on siting requests. At times, some of this information is not directly used during the CSAS meeting because it is determined to not be relevant or an appreciable risk. For example, based on bathymetry, location, or prevailing local oceanographic conditions, certain factors are deemed low risk and not considered further.

If some of these decisions could be codified (e.g., in a decision tree), it would streamline the process, perhaps considerably in some cases, which would benefit not only CSAS from a workload perspective, but also regional personnel, as they would not need to collect data that is not relevant for that particular siting application.

In other cases, a complete CSAS process was required to allow compliance when the proponent’s anchor line was several feet over the lease footprint. There was no increase in production or anything else that was different from the original licence agreement. This CSAS process took two to three years and the result was an indication no new mitigation was required. In cases where there is a lower risk (e.g., regional Aquaculture Management personnel determine that the habitat in the affected area is not different or sensitive), can the decision be made regionally to forego the CSAS process or use previous results?

The use of pesticides and herbicides can have important impacts to fish and fish habitat. As part of DFOs regulatory review of these type of projects, one key consideration is the benefit of the use of the pesticides contrasted to the impacts to non-target fish and fish habitat. In order to adequately weigh the benefits of such a project to the impacts it is necessary to better understand ecosystem recovery post treatment. 

As a first step, the AIS NCP plans to contract a literature review of all available pertinent information related to aquatic ecosystem recovery following the use of pesticides to control or eradicate invasive species. This literature review will include information on existing ecological definitions of ecological recovery, methods to encourage ecosystem recovery, monitoring criteria for ecosystem recovery, timelines associated to ecosystem recovery and knowledge gaps.

Once the AIS presence is confirmed, the program must consider what the best course of action is to protect Canadian waters from AIS, this includes consideration of chemical treatment. Currently, the AIS NCP has confirmed the presence of Black Crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) in New Brunswick and considering next course of action for removal in 2022 which may include chemical eradication. As mentioned above this information will inform our management decision on next steps.",0,,1,"Chemical eradication is one of several tools available for management of aquatic invasive species. Because the use of pesticides can be a sensitive topic in the public eye, controversial management decisions need to be taken based on scientific evidence. One of the major concerns often brought up is the impacts to the ecosystem and if it will recover. For this reason, when considering the use of pesticides for eradication or control of aquatic invasive species the AIS NCP weighs the benefits of eliminating the target species against the cost incurred by the ecosystem. A better understanding of ecosystem recovery will allow the AIS NCP to make an informed decision. 

Additionally, as the AIS NCP raises awareness in relation to the threat of aquatic invasive species more and more reports will be received, these may require action which could be as drastic as the use of pesticide. As mentioned above, the AIS NCP will need to make a decision soon on our course of action for Black Crappie, which could include the use of pesticides. It should also be noted that in relation to responding to the presence of invasive species, time is of the essence. As the invasion of a species progresses the cost to the ecosystem and the resources to control and manage them increases substantially.",99,"2021-11-10 19:46:44.097126",,232,232,122,232,Examen de la récupération écologique après traitement chimique,,2023,2022,1

Aside from some terms requiring definitions, which can be included as part of the science advice provided, they were supportive of the request.","In recent years, there has been increasing interest from rights holders and Indigenous groups, stakeholder organizations and other federal agencies in new supplementation programs including externally-led smolt-to-adult supplementation (SAS) programs to support Atlantic salmon conservation. SAS programs are a relatively recent stocking method that aims to circumvent the high mortality during Atlantic salmon’s natural marine phase by capturing wild smolts, rearing them in captivity and then releasing them back into a river to complete their life cycle. 

In 2015 and 2018, DFO Science reviewed, through Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) processes, the risks related to SAS programs and noted there are a number of genetic risks to wild populations in their undertaking, a position that is consistent with the best available science. In addition to the known risks associated with SAS programs, there is a need for an evaluation on the efficacy of both stocking and supplementation program to determine if the benefits of these activities justify the associated risks. It is expected that interest and pressure for clearer decision-making related to new regional supplementation efforts will grow with potential new Species at Risk listings for Atlantic Salmon.

There are existing DFO- and partner-led stock enhancement programs and identifying the efficacy of these programs for population recovery is required, given that three Maritimes Region DUs are pending SARA-listing decisions and information contained within this request would inform subsequent recovery planning. Recent Science advice on the iBoF Live Gene Bank program 15-year review (DFO 2018/041) indicated that it has been successful at maintaining genetic diversity within the DU, but not at recovering the population by re-establishing self-sustaining wild populations. The overall recovery goal for iBoF is to re-establish wild, self-sustaining populations as required to conserve the genetic characteristics of the remaining anadromous iBoF Atlantic salmon in which the LGB has only been partially successful.

Additionally, a regional coordination initiative is underway to develop a Regional Implementation Plan which will inform next steps for science and management programs and decision-making processes. The results from this advice will support regional objectives, priorities and recommendations on the direction of stock enhancement within our region.","If science advice is not provided, then decisions pertaining to existing and new stock enhancement programs by both science and management will continue to be based upon the risks of changing an existing or undergoing a new stock enhancement program without taking into consideration whether it is effectively supporting recovery of Atlantic salmon populations. 

Additionally, if the three DUs that are within the SARA-listing process are in fact listed without a clear understanding of the benefits and risks of the various stock enhancement approaches for Atlantic Salmon conservation and recovery, regional decisions with respect to supporting stock enhancement activities into recovery planning will be challenged.","2022-12-20 04:00:00","With the continuing decline of Atlantic salmon populations within Maritimes Region and the media attention that other enhancement programs receive within the region, it is expected that we will receive an increase in proposals for stakeholder-led stock enhancement programs to support population recovery activities.

The 2010 DUs are entirely within DFO Maritimes Region; however, the DFO pre-COSEWIC (Fall 2020) process that was undertaken for Atlantic Salmon in anticipation of the November 2022 COSEWIC Assessment was a multi-regional process including several other DUs of Atlantic Salmon. A similar approach may be undertaken for the RPA process and/or if there are DU boundary changes at the reassessment, a multi-regional process may be appropriate.

Led by Integrated Planning in Aquatic Ecosystems, regional discussions are also underway regarding prioritizing research and management approaches for all four Atlantic Salmon DUs (regardless of a SARA listing outcomes. This work would also be informed by RPA advice.","The Eastern Cape Breton (ECB), Outer Bay of Fundy (OBoF) and Nova Scotia Southern Upland (SU) DUs were assessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife (COSEWIC)in November 2010 and are under consideration for SARA listing. A listing decision is anticipated to occur in mid-late 2022. The Inner Bay of Fundy DU has been listed under SARA as endangered since 2003. 

All DUs of Atlantic Salmon are scheduled for reassessment by COSEWIC in November 2022. If a listing decision has not been made by this reassessment, SARP will require RPAs using the 2014 Terms of Reference for RPAs for all four DUs. 

If a listing decision is made prior to the November 2022 reassessment and all DUs are listed under SARA, a full RPA may not be required, but an updated threat assessment would be required in order to proceed with recovery planning. This threat assessment should include 1 - an identification of all threats to the species and its habitat, 2 - separate the threat by freshwater and, marine and estuarine environments, 3 - the threat risk associated with climate change, 4 - common terminology across DUs, 5 - the attributes of each threat (likelihood of occurrence, causal certainty, extent of occurrence, etc.) including the overall level of impact/risk associated with each identified threat (high, medium, low), 6 - an assessment of the cumulative effects of identified threats, to the extent possible, and 7 - brief narratives explaining both the impacts of each identified threats to the species in general and/or its habitat as well as any DU specific details.

The November 2022 COSEWIC reassessment may change the 2010 DU boundaries and so the RPAs and/or threat assessment will need to reflect the DUs and their boundaries as assessed in the 2022 reassessment.",N/A,"The RPA will provide the information and scientific advice needed to meet the requirements of the listing and recovery processes under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). The science advice from the RPA will ultimately help inform the decision of whether or not to list the species under SARA, as well as provide information that will help inform the potential management decisions under listing and non-listing scenarios, including the issuance of SARA permits. This information also feeds into the analysis of the socio-economic impacts of listing the species under SARA; therefore, the advice has the potential to significantly impact multiple DFO sectors and regions. Note that RPAs were previously undertaken for all four DUs of Atlantic Salmon; however, the RPAs  are outdated. The iBoF Salmon RPA was accomplished in 2008, whereas OBoF, SU and ECB were accomplished in 2013-2014. 

Threat assessments, including identifying the risk of all potential or known threats, are required for recovery strategies for species listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA).  Work is underway to amend the published iBoF Salmon recovery strategy to include new and updated information, including threats. The OBoF, SU and ECB Salmon are in the SARA listing process and if listed will require the development of one or more recovery strategies. The results of the threat assessment will be included in the recovery strategies to allow for the prioritization of threats and inform the development of the broad strategies to be taken to address those threats. The threat assessment will also be used to develop concrete actions in the development of SARA action plans. These documents represent departmental commitments to Atlantic Salmon recovery.

An iBoF Salmon threat assessment was accomplished prior to the most recent guidance and does not include a prioritization of the threats. Additionally, none of the previous threat assessments (undertaken in the RPAs) include an evaluation of the threat of climate change to Atlantic Salmon and inconsistent terminology was used across DUs in each RPA.","Regarding the RPA (i.e., if a listing decision for the 3 DUs does not occur prior to the reassessment): A listing decision for this species would be expected within approximately 2 years of the COSEWIC reassessment according to the new Listing Service Standards, which means a regional recommendation would be required by Fall 2024. The development of management scenarios, a socio-economic analysis, and public consultations would also be required after the RPA and within this 2 year timeframe.

Regarding the threat assessment (i.e., if the species are all listed under SARA before the reassessment): If Science advice is not provided, management decisions by Aquatic Ecosystem sectors, such as Species at Risk Program, Integrated Planning, Aquaculture Management, and Marine Planning and Conservation will be based on outdated knowledge. The Species at Risk Program for example will rely on the outdated threat assessment for the development of recovery strategies, however, it will be known to be less accurate and complete, and will require additional investments in time and engagement with Science to ensure complete and accurate, which has the potential to delay the completion of the recovery strategies. 

Note that even if all DUs are listed prior to the COSEWIC reassessment, if the boundaries of the DUs change, details of this request may need to be re-examined to determine whether additional advice (more than a threat assessment) is required.","2023-03-31 03:00:00","The COSEWIC Assessment is currently scheduled for November 2022; therefore, an RPA in Q1 or Q2 of 2023-24 would be required.

There is a recent CSAS SAR ""Guidance on the Identification of Critical Habitat in the Riparian Zone for Freshwater Species at Risk"" (CSAS SAR 2020/40) that suggests that riparian features should be considered as critical habitat for species at risk when appropriate, and identifies the processes supported by the riparian habitat that affect the survival and recovery of aquatic species. However this advice also indicated that species-specific widths of the riparian zone were not recommended due to a number of underlying factors, but that meta-analysis may provide more precise width recommendations.

Atlantic Salmon Recovery Potential Assessments (RPA) (e.g., DFO 2014/021) have identified riparian buffer as a feature of important Atlantic Salmon freshwater habitat, yet they have not clearly defined this feature and noted at that time that it remained a research issue (Caissie 2006, Bowlby et al. 2013). With the Science RPA advice the Species at Risk Program would be identifying riparian buffer as a feature of any identified freshwater critical habitat. Once identified this critical habitat will be protected from destruction via a critical habitat Order. It will be important to have a clear understanding of the appropriate buffer width to help support its protection and inform discussions with relevant regulatory bodies (provincial departments) who manage land-based activities (e.g., forestry, agriculture, mining) on appropriate management protocols to minimize impacts and avoid destruction to the riparian buffer of Atlantic Salmon critical habitat.

Recently work has been accomplished by Integrated Planning on “The importance of riparian zone management for fish and fish habitat protection: analysis and recommendations for an Ecologically Significant Area Case Study of the St. Mary’s River, Nova Scotia”. This work could possibly help contribute to this CSAS request.","No, but happy to discus.

As a first step in this process, there is a need to identify and then prioritize areas of ecological significance in freshwater environments. Application of the EBSA criteria (Ecosystem Status Report 2004/006) for identifying these areas has been recommended as the best approach, as it is consistent with what has already been done in marine and coastal environments in the Scotian Shelf Bioregion. Following this work, there will likely be a prioritization exercise of marine and coastal areas as candidate ESAs which may involve another DFO Science request. Additional requests for Science advice on threat identification and prioritization, conservation objectives, and other information pertaining to ESA identification will likely be submitted in future years.

End users of the EBSA identification exercise will primarily be the Integrated Planning Unit who will use this information to further the ESA candidate identification process (note that EBSA identification is not a critical path to ESA establishment but is the preferred approach).

A method of estimating total annual bycatch mortality within and across regions and priority fisheries is necessary to understand and manage human impacts to Porbeagle, and to ensure that fishing mortality, from all sources, is not exceeding 185mt annually (the proposed proxy for a 4% mortality rate, which is the maximum mortality rate that will allow the population to increase (DFO 2015/048)). 

The desired outcome of this process is to establish a methodology to estimate annual mortality across fisheries and regions, which could be updated on an ongoing basis. Ideally, this methodology would answer the following questions:

- Using the best available data (e.g. observer data, commercial data, survey data), what is the estimated total commercial bycatch in the Maritimes, Gulf, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec regions, in both tonnage and number of animals?  
- What proportions of bycatch can be attributed to specific fisheries? 
- How is bycatch temporally/spatially distributed? 
- How have bycatch estimates changed over time?
- What amount of bycatch is retained?
- When bycatch is discarded, what is the estimated post-release mortality for each fishery/gear type?
- What degree of confidence do the above estimates carry? What additional data sources or studies would further this analysis? If an estimate is not possible, what degree of observer coverage would be necessary to achieve this?
- How are these questions being addressed in other jurisdictions (e.g. ICCAT, USA)? Can these methods be applied in the Canadian context?

Priority fisheries include swordfish and other tunas pelagic longline, groundfish fixed gear and mobile gear, and other fisheries as deemed relevant by Science.","This request was first submitted in 2019/20. It was not added to the schedule. Subsequent conversation with Heather Bowlby (DFO Science) confirmed that some aspects of this work would be feasible for completion in 2022/23. For fleets with higher rates of observer coverage, interactions rates can be observed though it may not be possible at this time to extrapolate this to a fishery level. For fisheries with low rates of observer coverage, producing an estimate is not feasible at this time. While we recognize there may be some limitations that prohibit the questions being fully answered, we would be interested in having those limitations documented.","Porbeagle is currently being considered for listing under SARA. Should Porbeagle be listed as endangered, this information is necessary to inform permitting decisions, with respect to meeting section 73 pre-conditions. Regardless of whether Porbeagle is listed under SARA, accurate bycatch mortality estimates are necessary to implement and monitor management measures for the species, inform fisheries management decisions and to track the recovery of the species. In particular, a method of estimating total annual fishing mortality for Porbeagle is necessary to ensure that the 185mt cap is not being exceeded, which would prevent the population from increasing.","In the absence of this advice, outdated and potentially inaccurate/incomplete estimates of bycatch will be used as reference points in the management of Porbeagle. This could negatively affect the species if actual rates of bycatch and mortality are higher than the previously established estimates.","2023-03-31 03:00:00","As stated above, should Porbeagle be listed, this information is necessary to inform permitting decisions, with respect to meeting SARA section 73 pre-conditions.

Science advice in regard to standard approach distances allowed under SARA permits would create consistency in permits issued by all regions for similar activities. In some cases, permitted activities and their subsequent conditions can vary by region for similar applications because of the lack of formal advice on this topic.","Under the context of the Species at Risk Act (SARA) section 73 permit applications and permits, to support the SAR permitting review process, peer-reviewed science guidance is required to identify approach distances and cumulative impacts of various research activities, which may differ among SARA-listed species. Science advice is needed to address the questions below:

- What would be the minimum approach distance and speed by vessels of various sizes (e.g. Zodiac, fishing vessels, etc.) that should be allowed for all requested research and imaging activities (e.g. photographic identification, documentation of injuries, tagging, tissue sampling, etc.) for SARA-listed whales (e.g. North Atlantic Right Whale, Blue Whale, Beluga Whale, Fin Whale, Northern Bottlenose Whale, etc.)?

- What is the threshold for concurrent and/or cumulative research, imaging, and SARA-permitted activities beyond which there is an unacceptable level of harm and/or disturbance for SARA-listed whales in any given year, or more appropriate time frame (e.g. how many research vessels should be allowed to conduct simultaneous research work on or near North Atlantic Right Whales, how many different types of sampling or tagging should be allowed on North Atlantic Right Whales, at what point are vessel approaches of any given size or speed unduly harmful to individuals and a population)?",Stephanie Ratelle,"To support the SAR permitting review process, peer-reviewed science guidance is required to identify approach distances and cumulative impacts of various research activities, which may differ among SARA-listed species. The current multi-regional approach for review and issuance of SARA permits requires that a consistent, science-based approach be developed for permit applications, permits, and permit conditions to maximize information obtained to help species recover as well as minimize disturbance and harm to species.

Formal advice will have a large and equal impact across the four Atlantic Regions in their permitting processes and decisions, as well as improving the consistency and efficiency of multi-region SARA permits.","If science advice is not provided, there will be the continued risk of allowing undue harm/disturbance to SARA-listed whales in the issuing of permits. These SARA-listed whales are some of the most critically endangered in the world and are of priority to the department at large. The lack of formal advice adds to the uncertainty of the potential harm of permitted activities and the department is unable to evaluate and manage the risk of concurrent and cumulative effects on individuals and populations of SARA-listed whale species. There will also be inefficiencies in the coordination and decision making of SARA permits across the Atlantic regions, as regions struggle to determine what are appropriate conditions based on the risk and potential benefits of activities. Where one region may issue a permit for an activity under certain conditions, another region may not, due to lack of formal advice and knowledge of the risks.","2023-03-31 03:00:00","While SARA section 73 permit applications are expected every year and can arrive at any given time, submissions concerning SARA-listed whales are often concentrated in the spring months.

La dernière estimation de la taille et de la tendance de la population remonte à 2012. Depuis, de nouveaux relevés ainsi que des travaux visant à obtenir des facteurs de corrections plus adéquats pour les relevés visuels et photographiques ont été réalisés. Afin d‘éviter d’appuyer le nouveau programme de rétablissement sur des estimés périmés datant de près de 10 ans, nous souhaitons qu’une mise à jour de l’estimation de la taille et de la tendance de la population soit effectuée.

L'avis pourrait servir comme cas d'étude pour développer une méthodologie uniformisée afin de mener l'analyse à plus large échelle.","Question principale : Est-ce que les bélugas (population de l'estuaire du Saint-Laurent), rorquals bleus (population de l'Atlantique Nord-Ouest) et rorquals communs (population de l'Atlantique au Canada) courent un risque d'empêtrement dans les secteurs à l'étude pour le projet de zone de protection marine de l'estuaire du Saint-Laurent considérant qu'on y retrouve des pêches commerciales qui utilisent des engins jugés susceptibles de causer l’empêtrement?

- la pêche au crabe des neiges (casiers);
- la pêche au buccin (casiers);
- la pêche flétan du Groenland (filets maillants);
- la pêche au flétan du Groenland et flétan Atlantique (palangres).

Sous-questions :
- Pour chacune de ces pêches, quel est le risque d'empêtrement (p. ex. nul/négligeable, faible, modéré, élevé) pour le béluga, rorqual bleu et rorqual commun? 
- Quelles raisons expliquent ce niveau de risque (p. ex. chevauchement spatial et/ou temporel important, type de cordages utilisé, comportement du mammifère marin)? 
- Le risque varie-t-il ou s'explique-t-il en fonction de l'utilisation du secteur faite par les bélugas, rorquals bleus ou rorquals communs? P. ex. une aire d'alimentation, une voie de migration ou une aire de reproduction?
- Quelles peuvent être les conséquences des empêtrements pour le béluga, le rorqual bleu et le rorqual commun à l'échelle de l'individu (p. ex. noyade, blessures et infections, dépense énergétique accrue, difficulté à s’alimenter et à effectuer toute autre activité essentielle) et à l'échelle de leur population?
- L'information scientifique est-elle suffisante pour évaluer ce risque? Dans la négative, est-il recommandé de considérer l'adoption de l'approche de précaution (dite « approche de prévention » dans la Loi sur les océans), pour la zone de protection marine?
- En plus des 4 activités de pêches mentionnées précédemment, existe-t-il d'autres sources d'empêtrement associées aux pêches auxquelles les gestionnaires de la zone de protection marine devraient porter une attention particulière?

L'analyse devra seulement viser les secteurs à l'étude dont les priorités de conservation sont les mammifères marins en péril (Centre de l'estuaire, Haute-Côte-Nord et Matane-Les Méchins) et les 4 activités de pêches mentionnées précédemment, en considérant leur étendue spatiale et temporelle des 10 dernières années.","Véronique Lesage
Jean-François Gosselin","Cette demande d'avis scientifique constitue une mise à jour d'une demande datant de 2018 qui visait les mammifères marins de façon plus générale, ainsi que l'ensemble de l'estuaire et du golfe du Saint-Laurent. Dans le but d'accélérer le processus, elle est à présent circonscrite à trois espèces (béluga, rorqual bleu et rorqual commun) dans trois secteurs à l'étude dans le cadre du projet d'établissement de zone de protection marine de l'estuaire, et à trois types d'engins de pêche. Les données de pêche permettant de répondre à la question posée sont disponibles.  

L’avis scientifique servira au développement du règlement de zone de protection marine de l'estuaire du Saint-Laurent dont la désignation est prévue pour 2025. Afin de pouvoir autoriser une activité dans une zone de protection marine, les gestionnaires doivent être convaincus que l'activité soit compatible avec la protection des priorités de conservation (dans ce cas-ci, le béluga, le rorqual bleu, le rorqual commun), ou que le risque a été atténué efficacement par des mesures de gestion.

La demande d'avis scientifique est cohérente avec cette recommandation du plan d'action pour le rorqual bleu, population de l'Atlantique Nord-Ouest,« à la suite de nouvelles données issues de la photo-identification (Gaspard et al. 2017), il faudra réévaluer l’impact de la menace des empêtrements dans les engins de pêche, car elle pourrait être plus importante que l’on ne pensait auparavant » (MPO, 2020). Cette réflexion s'applique également au rorqual commun.

La méthodologie développée pour ce cas d’étude restreint aux secteurs à l'étude et aux espèces de mammifères marins visés par le projet d'aire marine protégée de l'estuaire du Saint-Laurent pourrait être appliquée de façon plus élargie dans le futur à l’ensemble de l’estuaire et du golfe du Saint-Laurent, ainsi qu’aux autres espèces de mammifères marins, de manière à répondre aux engagements du gouvernement du Canada en vertu de la Loi sur les espèces en péril et contribuer à répondre aux exigences du Marine Mammal Protection Act des États-Unis.","La création de zones de protection marine, les mammifères marins et les incidents d'empêtrement attirent grandement l'attention médiatique. Les gestionnaires de la zone de protection marine devront baser et justifier leurs décisions grâce aux meilleures connaissances scientifiques et ce, qu'ils proposent, ou non, des actions ciblant l'empêtrement. Or, il existe des lacunes de connaissances sur le risque d'empêtrement pour ces espèces dans l'estuaire du Saint-Laurent. Sans l'avis scientifique, il pourrait s'avérer très difficile de proposer et justifier des mesures de gestion pertinentes.

Le MPO a des responsabilités en conservation marine, mais également en gestion des pêches.

Dans notre cas précis, il s’agit d’une requête unifiée du MPO (DPCM, DGEP, QMM), de Parcs Canada (PMSSL) et aussi d'intérêt pour le G2T3M qui regroupe les principaux acteurs du domaine maritime circulant dans le Saint-Laurent. Pour plus d'information contacter Samuel Turgeon, coprésident du G2T3M (samuel.turgeon@dfo-mpo.gc.ca.).","Nous souhaitons obtenir de la part du secteur des Sciences une cartographie spatiale et temporelle des niveaux sonores cumulés dans l’habitat essentiel du bélugas, ainsi qu’une évaluation pour deux aspects en particulier : 1) efficacité des mesures provisoires à réduire le bruit dans les secteurs visés et les régions avoisinantes de l’habitat essentiel, et 2) identifier spatio-temporellement les aires de l’habitat essentiel du béluga du Saint-Laurent qui sont à l’heure actuelle moins bruyantes, et qui pourraient être considérées pour l’éventuel établissement de zones de tranquillité. Cet avis permettra d’outiller la gestion pour l’élaboration de mesures de conservation (réglementaires, volontaires, aire marine protégée, zones de tranquillité).

Des mesures de protection volontaires (réduction de vitesse, trajet de navigation recommandé, aire d’évitement des navires) sont en vigueur dans l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent depuis 2013 afin de réduire les risques de collision entre navires et baleines (cf. carte en annexe 1). Le Groupe de travail sur le trafic maritime et la protection des mammifères marins (G2T3M) s’apprête à décider si ces mesures doivent devenir permanentes, et si des ajustements en termes d’étendue géographique et temporelle sont opportuns. Ces mesures ont altéré l’environnement sonore dans les régions visées, et la présente demande vise à obtenir une évaluation à cet effet. De plus, les ministères responsables pourraient envisager la mise en place d’autres mesures de protection dans le cadre de leurs différentes initiatives pour atténuer le bruit sous-marin.

Comme les mesures volontaires sont en vigueur de manière saisonnière, une analyse saisonnière comparée tenant compte de l’exposition cumulée au bruit serait peut-être une avenue à exploiter pour évaluer l’efficacité des mesures provisoires.

Les espèces pour lesquelles l’efficacité des mesures provisoires devrait être évaluée incluent prioritairement le béluga et le rorqual bleu, bien que nous souhaitions également obtenir une évaluation similaire pour une autre espèce en péril (préoccupante) : le rorqual commun.",Dre Véronique Lesage et Dr Florian Aulanier,"Cette demande fait suite à la demande DGO_04/2018, qui a été présentée au Comité national d’examen par les pairs sur les mammifères marins (CNEPMM) en octobre 2019, touchant la cartographie des aires de distribution et de concentration saisonnières des espèces de rorquals vulnérables aux collisions dans l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent. 

Bien que cette demande ait une portée régionale, elle répond à une priorité nationale, soit la protection des baleines en voie de disparition au Canada. Elle contribue à la mise en œuvre du Plan d’action produit en vertu de la Loi sur les espèces en péril (LEP) afin de réduire l’impact du bruit sur le béluga et les autres mammifères marins en péril de l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent qui  identifie 32 mesures pour soutenir le rétablissement des populations. Cette demande permettra aussi de soutenir  le développement de mesures de conservation pour le projet d’une aire marine protégée dans l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent ayant comme but de protéger certains mammifères marins en péril, leurs proies et leur habitat. Elle répond également à un des objectifs nationaux du Plan de protection des océans du Canada d’atténuer les menaces visant les mammifères marins, notamment en étudiant les options pour atténuer les incidences du bruit généré par le transport maritime en milieu marin, et pour l’identification ou la mise en œuvre de mesures de gestion réglementaires ou non réglementaires visant à réduire l’impact du bruit dans le cadre du Programme de qualité du milieu marin. 

Volet 1. Efficacité des mesures provisoires

Motivées par le désir de réduire les risques de collision pour les grands rorquals dans l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent, les autorités du PMSSL et du MPO ont mis sur pied en 2012 le Groupe de travail sur le trafic maritime et la protection des mammifères marins (G2T3M) qui compte divers représentants de l’industrie du transport maritime, du gouvernement ainsi que du milieu académique. Le G2T3M a passé en revue plusieurs options. Parmi les options explorées figuraient des mesures de protection telles qu’une aire de vitesse réduite à 10 nœuds ou moins et une aire à éviter. 

Depuis juin 2013, des mesures de protection volontaires provisoires (réduction de vitesse et aire d’évitement des navires) ont été mises en place dans l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent. Elles sont publiées mensuellement par la Garde côtière canadienne dans les Avis aux navigateurs. Elles visent d’une part à réduire les risques de collisions entre les navires marchands et les grands rorquals. À la suite d’une première demande d’avis scientifique (Répercussions de la déviation du trafic maritime dans l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent sur le béluga, MPO 2014), les mesures volontaires ont été révisées pour inclure un trajet de navigation recommandé, de façon à minimiser l’impact du bruit sur les bélugas. La mise en place de ces mesures ne tenait pas compte de certaines données qui n’avaient pas été analysées, notamment sur la distribution des mammifères marins et la propagation du bruit à la tête du chenal laurentien. De plus, la mesure de réduction de vitesse volontaire a été restreinte en partie aux limites administratives du parc marin. 
 
Avant d’envisager des mesures de protection permanentes et de les faire reconnaître par l’Organisation maritime internationale (OMI), nous demandons au Secteur des sciences du MPO de fournir l’information scientifique pertinente, notamment sur les données de bruit sous-marin dans les différentes aires où les mesures de protection sont en vigueur dans l’estuaire. Cette information permettra aux gestionnaires de renforcer et étendre, au besoin, ces mesures de protection en se basant sur les meilleures informations scientifiques pertinentes disponibles. 

Volet 2. Zone de tranquillité

En vertu de la Loi sur les espèces en péril (L.C.2002), les ministères fédéraux compétents sont responsables de l’élaboration des plans d’action pour les espèces inscrites en voie de disparition. Une mesure de conservation et de rétablissement identifiée dans le Plan d’action pour réduire l’impact du bruit sur le béluga et les autres mammifères marins en péril de l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent vise à délimiter des zones spatiotemporelles destinées à réduire l’exposition du béluga au bruit à l’intérieur de son habitat essentiel, tout en tenant compte des contraintes de navigation, Ainsi, l’identification d’une ou de telles zones de tranquillité pourraient répondre à cette mesure du plan d’action, mais pourrait également être considérée comme une mesure de conservation potentielle dans le cadre du projet de création d’une aire marine protégée dans l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent.","Une conséquence de ne pas avoir de réponse ou de repousser cette demande risque de compromettre la mise en œuvre de mesures de conservation ou gestion de qualité avec les meilleures informations disponibles et déjà acquises par le MPO. L'impact du bruit est considéré comme un des principaux éléments de menaces au rétablissement d'espèces en péril dans l'estuaire. Il est important de souligner que pour évaluer correctement les impacts potentiels des bruits sous-marins sur le béluga de l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent, un programme quinquennal de recherche a été mis en place par une équipe scientifique de Pêches et Océans Canada à l'IML, dans la foulée du Plan de protection des océans lancé en 2016, où des financements ont déjà été octroyés. À l'origine les résultats de ces recherches devaient servir:

1) de cartographier la qualité acoustique de l’environnement du béluga,
2) de déterminer les zones et les périodes de plus grandes ou plus faibles probabilités d’impact pouvant affecter la survie du béluga et le rétablissement de cette population protégée en vertu de la Loi sur les espèces en péril au Canada
3) d'appuyer la mise en œuvre de mesures pour réduire le bruit basées sur des connaissances scientifiques. 

Cette demande est en lien avec les objectifs du Canada de préserver la biodiversité et de protéger 25% de ses milieux côtiers et marins pour 2025. Cette demande d’avis s’inscrit intégralement dans le Plan de protection des océans qui est une stratégie pangouvernementale (MPO, TC, GCC, ECC, RNC) et dont l’un des objectifs est d’accroître le transport maritime responsable et de protéger l’environnement maritime du Canada, de façon à atténuer les risques de la navigation sur l’environnement marin, dans l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent. 

Également cette demande est en appui au développement des mesures réglementaires de la future aire marine protégée Estuaire du Saint-Laurent sous la Loi des océans, avec un objectif d'établissement en 2025. L’évaluation de l’impact des mesures de protection en vigueur dans l’estuaire sur l’exposition cumulative au bruit sous-marin s’inscrit dans les programmes de rétablissement de deux espèces en péril : béluga et rorqual bleu et au plan d’action pour réduire l’impact du bruit sur le béluga et les autres mammifères marins en péril de l’ESL (proposé).

Le MPO et PC reçoivent plusieurs demandes des médias concernant les travaux de recherches et les mesures de gestion pour la protection des mammifères marins dans l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent.

Donc, cette revue scientifique répondra à un besoin de ces trois régions du MPO.","La question qui se pose et qui devrait faire l'objet d’un avis scientifique est identifier les zones d’importance écologique et biologique (ZIEB) du milieu côtier pour la biorégion de l'estuaire et du golfe du Saint-Laurent.

La Loi sur les océans confie à Pêches et Océans Canada (MPO) la direction et la coordination de l’élaboration et de la mise en œuvre d'un réseau national d'aires marines protégées, au nom du gouvernement du Canada, travail qui se poursuit dans le cadre de la planification spatiale marine. Cette priorité ministérielle repose en bonne partie sur l’identification des zones d’importance écologique et biologique (ZIEB). En 2006, le MPO a fait un large exercice de revue par les pairs afin d’identifier des ZIEB dans l’estuaire et le golfe du Saint-Laurent. Dix ZIEB avaient alors été identifiées, mais celles-ci se retrouvaient exclusivement en zone hauturière (MPO 2007). Des discussions avaient eu lieu alors sur l’inclusion des zones estuariennes et côtières dans l’évaluation des ZIEB pour le golfe sans arriver à un consensus sur une approche. La revue avait donc exclu toute la zone côtière de l’exercice de 2006.
Au cours du même atelier, on reconnaissait que l’influence des zones côtières sur le Saint-Laurent marin est probablement plus importante qu'on le pensait par le passé. De plus, il ne semble pas y avoir d’embûche majeure à utiliser un concept semblable à celui de ZIEB pour l’ensemble ou certains secteurs précis des zones côtières. Les zones côtières devraient faire l'objet d'une attention de gestion additionnelle pour les raisons suivantes : il s’agit de l’interface entre le continent et le Saint-Laurent, elles incluent des habitats productifs, leur rôle comme composante de l’écosystème est méconnu et les pressions exercées par les activités humaines y sont plus fortes qu’ailleurs et croissantes.
Afin de compléter les renseignements écologiques pour le développement d’un réseau d’aires marines protégées dans l’estuaire et le golfe du Saint-Laurent, l’identification des ZIEB en milieu côtier est ainsi devenue un élément majeur.

Ces ZIEB serviraient, entre autres, comme base pour le développement d’un réseau d’aires marines protégées pour la biorégion du golfe du Saint-Laurent. Elles contribueraient aussi à l’identification de vulnérabilités environnementales.

Comme c’était le cas dans la demande initiale, la demande touche l’ensemble du golfe Saint-Laurent et l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent, y compris le fjord du Saguenay et les côtes de Terre-Neuve.
Mentionnons qu’une première étape de cet avis a déjà eu lieu en décembre 2014. Lors de cet exercice, trois recommandations ont a été faites pour compléter l’exercice en question. Il s’agit de :
- réexaminer les autres couches d’information disponibles et pertinentes que l’on souhaite intégrer;
- revoir l’approche à prioriser pour identifier les ZIEB; et
- inclure la côte de Terre-Neuve dans l’exercice.","Certaines discussions avec des représentants des Sciences ont eu lieu à ce sujet, soit lors du processus en 2006 et en 2014. 
Une personne ressource ciblée plus récemment est Yanick Gendreau.","Cela contribue à la priorité organisationnelle du MPO de soutenir l'engagement pris dans le Discours du Trône pour ce qui est de donner suite aux conseils du Comité d’experts sur la sécurité des navires-citernes afin de créer un système de sécurité de classe mondiale pour ceux-ci, au moyen de la collecte et de l'analyse des renseignements et des données sur les sciences et les écosystèmes marins et appuyer le projet de planification régionale des interventions.
Cela contribue aussi à la priorité organisationnelle du MPO du Plan de conservation national, dont les objectifs sont d’accroître la conservation marine et côtière en élaborant et en mettant en oeuvre des cadres pour gérer les zones de protection marine (ZPM), établir de nouvelles ZPM et favoriser la progression des réseaux de ZPM.

permettre de mettre en relation les observations faites et les tendances observées dans les zones de protection avec celles dégagées de données provenant des relevés de recherche scientifique

De plus, les éléments clés à suivre(indicateurs) doivent être identifiés afin d’élaborer un protocole de suivi. Enfin, les méthodes d’échantillonnages choisies doivent être adaptées au suivi de ces éléments clés (ex. structure de l’habitat).

l’engagement du gouvernement du Canada envers les objectifs 2010 de la Convention pour la
diversité biologique et est une priorité ministérielle inscrite dans la lettre mandat du ministre.
 
La Stratégie comporte des objectifs spécifiques d’acquisition de connaissances sur les coraux et
éponges dont : étudier l’aire de répartition et la fonction écologique des coraux et éponges; mener des recherches sur le rôle que jouent les coraux et éponges dans l’écosystème général et leur importance pour les espèces ciblées par les pêches récréatives, commerciales et autochtones. Le suivi de l’évolution des communautés de coraux et d’éponges dans les zones ciblées permettra d’évaluer les mesures de protection mises en place.

Le protocole demandé permettra d’aborder la problématique de la vulnérabilité des coraux et des
éponges au prélèvement qui a été identifiée par le MPO comme un thème important du plan de
gestion intégrée du golfe du Saint-Laurent. Il permettra aussi d’avancer les mesures 5.2 et 5.4 à
l’appui des objectifs de conservation et de gestion de la stratégie de conservation des coraux et des éponges de l‘est du Canada (MPO, 2015). De plus, en appui aux objectifs de recherche de cette
stratégie, les mesures 2.1 à 2.3 sont traitées par cette demande.
 
Cette demande répond directement à l’objectif de la Stratégie de conservation des coraux et éponges. Ces organismes font partie de la biodiversité, mais sont aussi des espèces structurantes de l’habitat qui ont un rôle à jouer dans le cycle de vie des espèces halieutiques

Les résultats du présent avis serviront à informer le travail des biologistes du PPPH œuvrant en milieu marin et côtier dans différentes régions du MPO, notamment en matière de compensation de l’habitat du poisson. L’avis fourni sera plus particulièrement applicable aux régions du MPO présentant des caractéristiques maritimes similaires à celle du Québec, telles que la région du Golfe. 
Les résultats du présent avis pourraient également créer des opportunités subséquentes de suivis sur les récifs artificiels afin de supporter diverses hypothèses scientifiques (p. ex. : interactions écologiques, mobilité d’espèces benthiques, etc.). Les récifs artificiels peuvent être colonisés par une diversité d’espèce d’algues, benthiques et ichtyennes.","La Politique en matière de compensation du MPO préconise la restauration, l’amélioration ou la création d’habitats du poisson parmi les mesures compensatoires acceptables pour contrer les effets néfastes de projets de développement. Parmi les types de compensation les plus fréquemment proposés au PPPH dans la région du Québec par les promoteurs en milieu marin et côtier, on retrouve actuellement l’aménagement de récifs artificiels conçus pour le dépôt larvaire et la colonisation par le homard (récifs multigénérationnels à homard d’Amérique) ainsi que les récifs favorisant la colonisation par diverses espèces benthiques et les laminaires et la biomasse ichtyenne (récifs multiespèces). L’étude réalisée par Gendron et al. 2013 a démontré que les récifs artificiels multigénérationnels pour le homard mis en place dans la baie de Plaisance aux Îles-de-la-Madeleine constituaient des habitats propices pour le homard et le crabe commun, ainsi que pour plusieurs autres espèces. 
Les deux types de récifs artificiels (à homard et multiespèces) sont actuellement acceptés par le PPPH région du Québec. Ils ont une conception différente permettant de répondre aux objectifs pour lesquels ils ont été conçus, notamment indiqués ci-dessus, associés à leur colonisation biologique. Toutefois, les bénéfices réels pour le poisson et son habitat associés à l’aménagement de récifs selon leur type (à homards et multiespèces) et leur lieu d’implantation semblent devoir être mis à jour, en fonction de l’évolution des connaissances sur les espèces qu’ils visent et en considérant une vue à l’échelle de l’écosystème plutôt qu’à l’échelle d’un projet. Par ailleurs, les suivis des récifs installés pourraient aussi être améliorés en ce sens.  
Il est à noter que le PPPH avait soumis une demande d’avis sur les gains en productivité de récifs artificiels par le passé (DPP ER_01/2018 : Établissement d’un protocole expérimental sur la caractérisation du gain en productivité biologique engendré par la mise en place de récifs artificiels réalisés dans le cadre de projet de compensation en vertu de la Loi sur les pêches) qui n’avait pas été retenu. La présente demande complémente la précédente, mais elle nouvelle, en raison notamment de l’évolution des outils et des connaissances au sujet des récifs artificiels. 
Question 1 : Quels sont les effets écosystémiques liés à la mise en place de récifs artificiels en tant que compensation de l’habitat du poisson?
En bref, l’objectif derrière cette question est d’évaluer, selon les données scientifiques à jour et par une étude sur le terrain dans le Saint-Laurent, les effets positifs ou négatifs de l’implantation de récifs multigénérationnels à homard et de récifs multiespèces sur la faune aquatique et son habitat, en utilisant une approche écosystémique. Ceci inclura, notamment, la détermination de l’influence de ces structures sur les communautés benthiques et ichtyennes, qui les colonisent ou qui utilisent les habitats recherchés pour leur mise en place, le risque de prédation interspécifique lié aux récifs aménagés et l’évaluation du gain en productivité pour les espèces ciblées. 
Dans un premier temps, cette demande d’avis vise à mieux évaluer les effets sur le poisson et son habitat (positifs ou négatifs) liés à la mise en place de récifs artificiels, aménagés dans le cadre de projets de compensation réalisés en vertu de la Loi sur les Pêches, sur l'équilibre écosystémique d’un milieu récepteur. Pour ce faire, des recherches pourraient être réalisées par les scientifiques du MPO sur les différents récifs existants dans le Saint-Laurent (Île-de-la-Madeleine, Gaspésie, Côte-Nord) ou ceux prévus être installés dans un avenir rapproché par des promoteurs. Ceci dans le but d'assurer une gestion durable et collaborative de l'écosystème, selon les fondements scientifiques les plus à jour. 
Cette étude aurait pour but, plus particulièrement, de répondre aux préoccupations associées à la pression de prédation accrue sur le crabe commun par le homard d’Amérique qui pourrait être observable entre autres dans le contexte des récifs à homard. Des échanges récents entre la DRS et le PPPH (p.ex. : courriel de M. B. Ste Marie à A. Lagacé) illustrent que ce questionnement mérite actuellement d’être adressé, soit : 
«(…) nous nous sommes inquiétés de la pression de prédation accrue sur le crabe commun par le homard que pourraient entraîner ces récifs. L’augmentation naturelle et soutenue des populations de homard le long des côtes du Québec ces deux dernières décennies semble en effet s’accompagner d’un déclin de l’abondance du crabe commun (proie importante du homard) et dans ce contexte il semblerait peu opportun d’« introduire » du homard dans des zones refuges (fonds sablonneux) pour le crabe commun. À terme, si le déclin du crabe commun est confirmé et s’accentue, c’est le homard qui en subira les conséquences puisque cet élément de son régime alimentaire est essentiel à une bonne condition physiologique et reproductrice. (…) même si les fonds sablonneux paraissent parfois peu productifs et importants, ils peuvent servir de refuges à certains organismes de façon saisonnière (crabe des neiges) ou continue (crabe commun) et ainsi contribuer à l’équilibre de l’écosystème plus vaste et à la productivité de populations d’invertébrés commerciaux qui n’y sont pas résidentes.»
Par le fait même, le PPPH désire aussi déterminer si des questionnements similaires pourraient être identifiés dans le cadre des récifs multiespèces qui sont installées dans des endroits sablonneux et faiblement productifs, similaires aux sites d’implantation généralement préconisés pour les récifs à homard.
À partir de cette question, le PPPH souhaite obtenir des précisions quant à l’importance écosystémique des milieux actuellement recherchés pour la mise en place des récifs (p. ex. : milieu meuble, peu profond et peu productif), à savoir notamment si ces types d’habitats ou zones de refuges abritent des fonctions sensibles pour la faune aquatique ou consistent en des endroits particulièrement recherchés par certaines espèces benthiques ou ichtyennes. 
Le PPPH est conscient qu’il est probable que les récifs artificiels, dans certains contextes, puissent générer une pression de prédation accrue sur les proies qui utilisent les zones refuges recherchées pour leur implantation. À cet effet, nous aimerions obtenir davantage de détails associés entre autres aux espèces proies les plus susceptibles de voir leur prédation accrue par les récifs, selon si l’on est dans un contexte de récifs à homard ou de récifs multiespèces. De même, si un milieu d’implantation serait préférable à un autre, en fonction notamment de la vitalité d’une population benthique donnée, tel le homard d’Amérique. 
D’ailleurs, nous nous questionnons à savoir si un déséquilibre écosystémique serait possible en raison des récifs implantés ou à être aménagés dans l’estuaire maritime et le golfe du Saint-Laurent. Le PPPH est intéressé à en apprendre davantage sur l’existence potentielle d’une capacité de support d’un secteur attribuable à un récif artificiel ou à une quantité de récifs donnés au-delà de laquelle il n’y aurait possiblement pas de bénéfice supplémentaire attendu, voire au-delà de laquelle l’aménagement pourrait même avoir un impact négatif sur les espèces ciblées. Dans un tel cas, le PPPH aimerait que soit identifiés un nombre maximal de récifs artificiels pouvant être aménagé dans un secteur et aussi des emplacement dans l’estuaire maritime ou le golfe du Saint-Laurent qui auraient déjà atteint la capacité de support de par la présence actuelle de récifs artificiels. Dans ce contexte, les informations recherchées seraient les effets négatifs possibles sur les écosystèmes concernés et sur les espèces pouvant être observés sur ces récifs. 
À la vue de ce qui précède, le PPPH région du Québec souhaite obtenir une validation et une mise à jour de son outil d’estimation interne des gains de productivité biologique pouvant être attribuables à la présence des récifs à homard et de récifs multiespèces. Cet outil interne a été élaboré de concert avec des renseignements et du personnel scientifiques issus notamment de : Gendron, L., F. Hazel, N. Paille, P. Tremblay, S. Pereira, M. Desrosiers, L. Roberge et R. Vaudry. 2013. Aménagement de récifs artificiels multigénérationnels pour le homard d’Amérique (Homarus americanus) dans la baie de Plaisance aux Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Québec. Rapp. tech. can. sci. halieut. aquat. 3044. X +76 p. Il estime des ratios moyens du gain en productivité engendré par les différents types de récifs pouvant être réalisés comme projet de compensation. Le PPPH espère aussi que l’étude qui pourrait être menée ci-dessus, sur les effets écosystémiques des récifs, pourrait permettre de mettre à jour les ratios internes d’estimation de productivité biologique et possiblement d’éventuellement les partager avec les promoteurs et le public.
Facultatif - Question 2 : Est-ce que les protocoles d’évaluation et de suivi recommandé pour les récifs à homard et multiespèces pourraient être améliorés? 
La demande d’avis vise, si possible, à obtenir une validation et la mise à jour du protocole de suivi des récifs actuellement préconisé par le PPPH région du Québec aux promoteurs et qui tient compte des deux types de récifs artificiels aménagés (1. multigénérationnel à homard; 2. multiespèces) et des différents milieux d’implantation. Le PPPH espère recevoir des propositions d’amélioration, notamment pour que les suivis des récifs aient une portée davantage écosystémique et qu’ils puissent être reproduits relativement facilement par un promoteur ou son consultant.","Nous n'avons pas encore eu la chance de discuter de façon préliminaire de la présente demande d'avis avec le personnel scientifique du MPO. Nous souhaitons toujours toutefois le faire auprès des chercheurs appropriés de la Direction des sciences démersales et benthiques (DSDB) et de la Direction des sciences pélagiques et écosystémiques (DSPE). 
Des demandes préliminaires ont été lancées en ce sens auprès de la directrice de la DSSB et du directeur de la DSPE. Nous espérons pouvoir tenir une réunion avec divers scientifiques qui pourraient être concernés par des espèces pouvant être présentes sur les récifs artificiels ou subir certains effets attribuables à leur mise en place (p. ex. homard d'Amérique, crabe commun, crabe des neiges, algues, oursins, etc.) et aussi de chercheurs qui traitent également de l’écosystème dans son ensemble.","La Loi sur les Pêches exige la réalisation de projet de compensation afin de contrebalancer pour les répercussions occasionnées au poisson et à son habitat par différents projets de développement. L’appui des sciences permettrait de mieux évaluer et encadrer ces types de projets, que ce soit en termes de localisation, d’ampleur de la compensation, de suivis, etc. 
Dans le plan ministériel de 2021-2022, celui des années subséquentes n’étant pas actuellement disponible, mais dont on peut s’attendre à des similarités, il est fait mention de priorités et des engagements liés au mandat de notre Ministère : 
• mettre en œuvre la Loi sur les pêches modernisée et poursuivre l’élaboration du Plan de protection des océans au moyen de la planification spatiale marine des plans de cogestion et des mesures visant à protéger des baleines; 
• miser sur des preuves scientifiques et le savoir traditionnel autochtone lors de la prise de décisions ayant des répercussions sur les stocks de poissons et la gestion des écosystèmes.
De plus, le ministère entend : 
• élaborer une stratégie exhaustive relative à l’économie bleue qui sera le cadre global en matière des océans afin d’orienter les actions et les investissements futurs du gouvernement qui aideront le Canada à développer son économie océanique pour créer de bons emplois pour la classe moyenne et des occasions pour les collectivités côtières tout en faisant progresser nos objectifs de conservation; 
Tous ces éléments sont associés à la présente demande, notamment puisque la compensation est étroitement lié à la Loi sur les pêches et qu’elle vise aussi à protéger et restaurer les habitats océaniques. 
De plus, nous avons eu des cas concrets récemment durant lesquels nous avons été informés de préoccupations associées à la mise en place de tels récifs artificiels. Nous désirons en apprendre plus au sujet de ces préoccupations et de miser davantage sur le savoir scientifique lors des prises de décision associées à ces types de projets compensatoires. Tout ceci, afin de s’assurer d’une gestion saine et collaborative de l’écosystème marin et côtier. 
Les stratégies sur les océans, qui comprends notamment sur le plan de protection des océans, et de l'économie bleue, misent la préservation et la restauration des écosystèmes marins et sur les sciences de l'océan, l'innovation et le rôle qu'ont les sciences dans la prise de décisions éclairées en ce qui concerne la gestion durable de nos océans.","Les récifs artificiels sont, depuis plusieurs années maintenant, les principales options compensatoires envisagées par les promoteurs de projet de développement en milieu marin et côtier dans la région du Québec. Certains promoteurs souhaitent aménager plusieurs récifs de pierre ou de béton dans le Saint-Laurent. L’encadrement et les limites de ces options doivent avoir un fondement scientifique robuste. 
Le rayonnement des projets de compensation dont le succès est démontré en continu est important pour l’opinion publique sur le rôle du MPO dans la protection des habitats et des espèces aquatiques. Le PPPH utilisait jusqu’à présent des protocoles internes d’évaluation et de suivi des récifs multigénérationnels à homard et multiespèces, élaborés sur certaines bases scientifiques. Une évaluation plus approfondie des effets écosystémiques liés à l’aménagement de récifs est nécessaire à ce stade, selon les connaissances acquises sur les espèces de l’estuaire maritime et du golfe du Saint-Laurent. 
Le PPPH doit répondre aux inquiétudes grandissantes de la part des scientifiques associées à la pression de prédation accrue sur le crabe commun par le homard d’Amérique, dans le contexte d’aménagement de récifs à homard. Le PPPH a aussi été récemment interpellé par les médias dont l’intérêt se tourne de plus en plus vers l’implantation de récifs multiespèces de béton dans le Saint-Laurent.
Actuellement et dans le contexte que l’avis ne puisse être fourni, il apparaît difficile pour le PPPH de prendre des décisions éclairées sur ces types de compensation, sans nouveaux renseignements ni études scientifiques plus poussées sur les effets écosystémiques associés aux récifs. L’avis requis permettra au PPPH de mieux orienter les promoteurs sur ces options compensatoires, telles que de les réserver pour des contextes ou des secteurs précis, de s’en tenir à l’un ou l’autre de ces types de récifs artificiels, d’optimiser compensations pour obtenir le plus grand bénéfice écosystémique ou même voire à orienter dès maintenant les promoteurs vers la recherche de nouvelles options de compensation en milieu marin. 
Sans cet avis, le MPO pourrait passer à côté de possibilités de création et d’amélioration d'habitats du poisson dans un contexte où les options compensatoires proposées par les promoteurs en milieu marin ne sont pas nombreuses actuellement, mais elles doivent être pertinentes et suffisantes pour contrebalancer les effets néfastes sur le poisson et son habitat.","2023-03-15 03:00:00","La Loi sur les Pêches exige la réalisation de projet de compensation afin de contrebalancer pour répercussions occasionnées au poisson et à son habitat par divers projets de développement autorisés. Il s’agit d’une exigence règlementaire. Or, les récifs artificiels multigénérationnels pour le homard et multispécifiques représentent un projet de compensation de plus en plus proposé par les promoteurs de projets en milieu marin et côtier au Québec. L’équipe milieu marin du PPPH de la région du Québec traite actuellement plusieurs projets de développement ou de réserves d’habitat impliquant l’aménagement de récifs dans le Saint-Laurent. 
La date limite permettra d’évaluer de manière plus éclairée le potentiel d’utilisation des options compensatoire des récifs artificiels pour les projets actuels et à venir dans les prochaines années. 
La date limite est aussi importante pour préparer des appels d'offres pour la planification d'études connexes du PPPH sur le terrain pour l'été-automne 2022.

Bien qu'encore au stade exploratoire dans certaines zones, la pêche de l'oursin constitue une activité très importante pour les titulaires de permis qui la pratiquent, dont 3 communautés autochtones. 

La dernière évaluation remonte à 2016 et n'incluait pas toutes les zones de pêche.
Plusieurs zones de pêche, bien qu'exploitées annuellement depuis plus de 25 ans, sont encore au stade exploratoire. Dans ce contexte, il est nécessaire de mettre à jour les indicateurs afin de s'assurer que les mesures de gestion actuelles permettent d'assurer la viabilité et la durabilité des activités de pêche. 

En 2017, différents intervenants de la zone 9 (coordonnateur des pêches autochtones, plongeurs, titulaire de permis) ont exprimé des craintes pour l’état de la ressource dans la sous-zone 9-1. En 2019, Parcs canada et certains pêcheurs ont réitéré leurs inquiétudes par rapport à l’état des stocks. La zone 9 est la plus importante au Québec en matière de débarquements. La limite maximale quotidienne a été abaissée à 4200 kg/jour en 2018 (comparativement à 6000 kg/jour précédemment). Cette pêche regroupe les intérêts de divers pêcheurs et communautés autochtones.

In recent years, landings have increased, consistent with higher occurrence in the DFO bottom trawl survey. Despite a more positive outlook, jonah crab appear to sustain only low fishing pressure and the number of crab retained as bycatch from the lobster fishery has been historically underestimated. Science advice has been requested for the 2021-22 fiscal year to review at-sea data collected in the lobster fishery in LFAs 33 to 35 to provide estimates of incidental catch of key bycatch species, including Jonah crab.

Or, le COSEPAC a désigné la population de Béluga de la baie d'Ungava (BU)en voie de disparition. On estime que cette population serait composée de moins de 100 individus.
Afin de protéger cette population, l'estuaire de la Mucalic est fermé aux activités de chasse depuis plus de 30 ans par règlement. Depuis la mise en œuvre du plan de gestion, des activités de chasse limitées peuvent y être autorisées au cas par cas sous réserve de l'approbation du Ministre.
L'identification de la population de la baie d'Ungava est fondée sur des observations historiques. Toutefois, le nombre d’échantillons existants ne permet plus de déterminer s’il s’agit d’une population distincte de celles de l’Est et de l’Ouest de la Baie d’Hudson. De plus, lors des relevés des populations de béluga au Nunavik par recensement aérien en 2011 et 2015, la Baie d’Ungava n’a pu être couverte pour des raisons logistiques. 
Selon les chasseurs Inuit des communautés environnantes, les bélugas qui fréquentent l’estuaire de la Mucalic ne seraient pas génétiquement différents de ceux se retrouvent dans le Détroit d’Hudson et dans le Baie d’Ungava. Leur abondance serait liée à différents facteurs environnementaux dont la présence tardive de glace dans le Détroit. Les communautés de Kuujjuaq et de Kangiqsualujjuaq exercent alors des pressions sur le Conseil de gestion  des ressources fauniques de la région marine du Nunavik pour que cette zone puisse être rouverte à la chasse.
Un projet de recherche a été convenu entre les Sciences et le Conseil de gestion des ressources fauniques de la Région marine du Nunavik. Le Conseil a exigé que les Sciences conviennent avec le RNUK des méthodes de recherche à employer : au cours de l’année 2019, des observateurs sur le terrain ont noté la fréquentation, effectué des biopsies par arbalètes ainsi que des prélèvements d’eau (ADN environnemental). Des images satellitaires ont également été analysées.
Cette demande d’avis vise d’une part à obtenir le support des Sciences pour l’analyse des échantillons, pour l’acquisition de données complémentaires et pour un avis sur l’origine des bélugas de l’estuaire de la Mucalic.

As part of the process, we require expert advice and/or peer review of the guide to ensure it is based on current information and is appropriate for external and internal use.The mitigation guide describes the conditions under which specified mitigation measures are applicable to Government of Canada led activities or projects involving the use of active sonar.The suggested measures are voluntary and can be incorporated into the planning and operation of navigation, research or hydrography and sea floor mapping activities in order to avoid or minimize negative impacts to the marine environment as a result of underwater noise.Questions for science: - Is the advice provided in the Active Sonar Mitigation Guide consistent with existing DFO Science advice ?- Is the advice provided in the Active Sonar Mitigation Guide consistent with current research/knowledge of impacts from active sonar noise?- Are the suggested measures suitable for mitigating the impacts of underwater noise produced by active sonar on marine animals?",Joclyn Paulic,"The advice coming from the peer review would directly inform the guide and decisions within regional programs on development, ocean floor mapping activities or research proposals related to sonar underwater noise. The guide and outcomes of the peer review would be useful for informing Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program decisions and considering how to minimize the impacts of underwater noise on marine mammals. There are initiatives under the OPP which would directly benefit from this information, such as Marine Environmental Quality. The Marine Planning and Conservation Program, Species at Risk Program and the Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program are involved in various planning and review activities that require the protection of the marine environment from the effects of active sonar activities.  Concerns from other departments, Industry, Northern Indigenous partners and stakeholders regarding the absence of approved 'guidelines' have been raised.The issue of the use of active sonar in or near Canadian waters and its impact on ocean ecosystems and marine life in particular is a significant one for the Arctic Region due to the increase in vessel activity and development in the north.   This review could lead to providing suggested mitigation measures to employ when working in proximity to protected areas and marine mammals.  Under the Oceans Act, the MEQ program has a mandate to identify science and management gaps, assess the impact of noise and other stresses on marine species and the ecosystems that sustain them and to develop or adapt measures to mitigate and manage risks. As part of the Establishing MEQ measures initiative of the Ocean Protection Plan, the MEQ program is committed to developing at least one measure to address noise and an Ocean Noise Strategy for Canada by 2021-2022. This information will be used by the MEQ program to inform appropriate underwater ocean noise measures.This information will also be used by the Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program as they are the lead in making regulatory decisions under the Fisheries Act and Species at Risk Act with respect to noise producing activities in the marine environment such as the use of active sonar. The advice may be combined with other departmental advice and submitted to the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada or other regulators in support of federal/provincial and territorial environmental assessments.The potential impacts from underwater noise in the Arctic is of interest to Arctic Council members and particularly the Inuit people living throughout the region. Nationally, the Government of Canada Ocean Noise Strategy will promote the mitigation of harmful anthropogenic sourced underwater noise in Canadian Waters.  An active sonar guide used by federal departments is a logical first step.","The expected course of action if a science review is not provided is for the federal family and Industry to continue to undertake the use of active sonar in the absence of guidelines.  If this advice is not provided, the region would be unsuccessful in supporting further policy and regulatory recommendations which should reference the guide. In the absence of a guide, staff would direct internal programs and proponents to continue to apply ad hoc mitigation.  We would fail to advance effective mitigation of impacts from underwater noise on vulnerable species under DFO's purview, such as marine mammals, in the Arctic.

DFO is moving toward a Sustainable Fisheries Framework for key fisheries that contains existing DFO policies for resource management decisions, and builds on new policies to address ecosystems factors and precautionary considerations.  Narwhal are harvested not only in their summering ranges, but elsewhere during their spring/fall migration. Spring/fall narwhal harvests are presumed to target a migrating mix of different management units, but it has not been possible to assign spring/fall narwhal kills to individual management units. In 2010, new genetics analysis demonstrated some differences among narwhal summering aggregation stocks (Petersen et al. 2011/021).  Within Baffin Bay, partial support was found for the existing summering stock management unit designations. The analysis suggests that narwhals from Jones Sound and the Somerset Island summering stock are differentiated, although the Somerset Island finding may be influenced by low sample numbers. The report recommended that increased sampling of most stocks is suggested to increase the understanding of how stocks are related and at what rate migration among stocks may occur.  For management purposes, it is necessary to determine the level of hunting mortality incurred by each stock during migration,  and identification of stock structure is needed to facilitate management both nationally and internationally.  Updated science information and advice, as well as a documented management approach is required for sustainable narwhal management.

With the completion of stock assessments for Halovik and Jayko Rivers in 2020 and an assessment for the Lauchlan River Planned for 2023, Ekalluktok (Ekalluk) and Surrey (Paliryuak) Rivers have been identified as the next rivers to be assessed.

Consideration of genetic population structures and migratory behavior in Cambridge Bay region may be required to adequately and appropriately assess the fishery. Cambridge Bay Arctic Char is a key fishery for DFO Arctic Region. DFO is moving toward a Sustainable Fisheries Framework for key fisheries that contains existing DFO policies for resource management decisions, and builds on new policies to address ecosystems factors and precautionary considerations. Additionally, the Cambridge Bay Arctic Char fishery has been identified in Batch 2 of the Fish Stock Provisions, whereby a rebuilding plan will be required to support sustainable management.  The commercial fishery in Cambridge Bay began to operate in 1960 and has expanded the number of commercial water bodies exploited  to currently include 5 major water bodies (Ekalluktok (Ekalluk), Surrey (Paliryuak), Jayko, Halokvik (30 MILE), and Lauchlan (Byron Bay) Rivers). Stock assessment studies have been conducted by DFO sporadically on these active commercial water bodies throughout the years, and most recently in accordance with a multi-year Science plan established in 2013.  Ekalluktok (Ekalluk) and Surrey rivers are the remaining waterbodies that require population abundance estimates, stock structures and sustainable harvest levels.  The plant sampling program was implemented by DFO in an effort to collect annual basic information on the char harvested as part of monitoring efforts on the commercial fishery.  The plant sampling program is primarily the only scientific information DFO receives on these stocks and provides DFO with basic biological data. However, neither the sampling program nor harvest reporting capture complete CPUE. Given the scale and significance of this commercial fishery to the Region, the community and the Nunavut Territory, and the successful  approval of the Cambridge Bay Arctic Char Commercial Fishery IFMP in 2014, there is a need to complete population abundance estimates and establish sustainable harvest level recommendations for all commercial waterbodies, to ensure that these stocks are being harvested at sustainable levels and the fishery will continue to be sustainable over the long term. This need has been identified in the IFMP as an issue and objective of the fishery. Stock Assessment has developed a multi-year stock assessment plan for the Cambridge Bay fishery in conjunction with and in support of the Cambridge Bay Stock Assessment Working Group. This multi-year Science plan was approved in 2013 and is reviewed annually. Time-frames for completing population abundance estimates and establishing river specific sustainable harvest level recommendations have been determined, based on the Science plan and current activities.

One option for obtaining a population estimate could be to use underwater cameras that are baited to attract sharks in the area. To examine population impacts of Greenland Shark bycatch, an assessment of post-capture survival rates is needed, as well as an assessment of fishery-dependent data on encounters, including catch rate (number of sharks), estimated length, state at time of capture (alive or dead, caught by mouth or entangled) and condition at release.

DFO is moving toward a Sustainable Fisheries Framework for key fisheries that contains existing DFO policies for resource management decisions, and builds on new policies to address ecosystems factors and precautionary considerations.In the first two years of a summer (open water) fishery, the Cumberland Sound Turbot Management Area (CSTMA) fishery experienced very high Greenland Shark and Arctic Skate bycatch. In 2009 and 2010, the highest shark bycatches occurred at the beginning of the fishing season, though this corresponded to different dates (the duration of September in the first year and early August in the second year). Data obtained thus far seem most consistent with the sharks being “fished out” at the beginning of the fishing season, rather than seasonal movement of sharks into and out of the CSTMA. An open water fishery also occurred in the NAFO Division 0B portion of Cumberland Sound in 2010 and 2011, and also experienced very high shark bycatch. An ice fishery, prosecuted annually since 1986, also experiences shark bycatch.Survival rates of live-released discarded sharks is unknown. Thus, to ensure that viability of the shark population is not being compromised, DFO Resource Management requires that impacts of the Greenland Shark (and potentially Arctic Skate) bycatch in the Cumberland Sound Greenland Halibut fishery be investigated. Obtaining an estimate of population abundance will be an important first step prior to assessing impacts of bycatch on the Greenland Shark population in Cumberland Sound.DFO Resource Management will use this advice to provide recommendations to the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) to mitigate impacts on Greenland Sharks. DFO Science advice will be considered by the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) in providing a Total Allowable Harvest (TAH) decision to the Minister. The NWMB typically considers establishing or modifying levels of TAH in a public forum, and vocal parties would most likely include fishing industry, territorial government, Designated Inuit Organizations (e.g. Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.) and the local Hunter's and Trapper's Organization.The Precautionary Approach involves setting biologically based reference points and establishing pre-agreed, risk-based actions.This information is required as part of an Integrated Fisheries Management Plan.The provision of this information/advice is required to support departmental priorities:- The Cumberland Sound Greenland Halibut fishery is a key fishery for DFO Arctic Region, contributing to economically prosperous maritime sectors and fisheries (modernization of the fisheries). - A sustainable commercial (or exploratory) fishery supports the development of commercial and emerging fishing activities in the North (responding to changing ecosystems, modernization of the fisheries).- Implementation of the Sustainable Fisheries Framework and the Fishery Decision-making Framework - Incorporating the Precautionary Approach are based on scientific information (responding to changing ecosystems).- Ensure coordinated approach to modernization of the fisheries, including providing science and fisheries management information (modernization of the fisheries).- Advice will be considered by stakeholders and fishing industry, deepening engagement and key partnerships.","It is unknown whether the current bycatch levels are sustainable for bycatch species, especially Greenland Shark. Although bycatches in offshore Greenland Halibut fisheries appear to be well within a limit of 5% of the weight of the directed species, for each species on a per trip basis, in the first two seasons of a CSTMA open water Greenland Halibut fishery, this limit has been exceeded. The ice fishery, prosecuted annually since 1986, also experiences shark bycatch. At the same time, federal and territorial governments, industry and community resource users and stakeholders have all invested considerable resources into developing this fishery. For example, a Small Craft Harbour is being constructed in the community where this fishery is based. Without DFO Science advice, there is a risk that DFO will be unable to manage expectations and maintain confidence of fishery participants, potentially leading to the loss of partnerships.

Short-term water level drawdowns result in improved habitat conditions for waterfowl and, despite the obvious loss of habitat in the short term (as well as possible harm or jeopardy to survival and recovery of some species), also appear to improve habitat conditions for wetland SARA listed fishes and other SARA listed species in the long term. Previous assessment (CSAS Response 2021/012) specifically examined short-term ecological impact of water-level drawdown on lake chubsucker in the east cell of St Clair NWA but did not consider long-term risks of inaction, the long-term benefits of habitat management to lake chubsucker, or impacts or benefits at any timescale to other SAR.   1.

The advice will provide the knowledge base required to make informed ecosystem-based decisions with respect to SARA permits that may allow projects to proceed; the advice will also be useful in engaging other organizations in making evidence-based decisions to provide maximum benefit to multiple species which may have competing needs within diked wetlands.  The advice is likely to inform questions about similar work in other locations and regions of interest to DFO.This information will promote an ecosystem approach (that includes the needs of SAR fishes) to habitat manipulations within diked areas of coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes.  Previously, such initiatives were focused on waterfowl and to a lesser extent, other non-fish taxa.  The request will help ECCC and DFO fulfill their roles under SARA of promoting the survival and recovery of SARA listed species found in diked wetlands.

Though this CSAS request is generalised to the Pacific Region, it may be additionally helpful if the CSAS could provide illustrative examples or recommendations based on the context of the Fraser River.","Expected consequences of not getting this science advice:-Continued habitat degradation and loss in estuaries -Continued impact to fish species in estuaries-Negative media attention from lack of involvement in management planning programs for priority estuaries-Negative responses from the public, stakeholders, and indigenous groups for lack of involvement in conservation and management of estuaries-Less strategic or cost-effective management actions","2023-12-31 04:00:00","This work builds upon past research and can incorporate some existing spatial data.

Currently, there does not exist a framework for evaluating the potential effectiveness of measures to offset underwater noise as a result of Development Projects. EMB is working to develop such a framework that will be informed by a workshop with subject matter experts in December 2021. The development of a draft framework will be accompanied by initial modelling work evaluating  the effectiveness of underwater noise management measures to offset TMX-related noise. The Framework being developed builds on past Science advice, most notably the recommendation to implement measures in order to achieve net-zero increase in underwater noise.

The advice will be used to further refine the framework for continued evaluation of underwater noise management measures which will in turn impact how the measures themselves are adaptively managed over time.","Should advice not be received then EMB would not be able to make a decision on whether to pursue the proposed Framework for Underwater Noise.  As such, EMB will be unable to confidently evaluate whether TMX-related effects from underwater noise on SRKW have been fully offset.

Strait of Georgia Bioregion,Cherisse Du Preez,"Cold seeps occur where hydrocarbon-rich water escapes from beneath the sea floor, often near boundaries of tectonic plates, and are characterized by unique communities associated with chemosynthetic bacteria and carbonate crust structures (DFO, 2018). Many of the species found in these communities may be endemic to cold seeps, which were designated as Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs) in the Pacific Region in 2018 (DFO, 2018). Despite this, cold seeps have never been systematically inventoried or mapped within the region, although they have been found in three of the four bioregions. Relative to the American Pacific coast, we have very little information on the location and extent of cold seeps, but Science estimates that there are likely thousands within the Canadian Pacific region (DFO, 2018). Much like hydrothermal vents, cold seeps can form large rocky structures, providing places for cold water corals and sponges to anchor and shelter areas for ecologically and commercially important fish species (DFO, 2018). One of the most well studied cold seeps, the site of a research node for Ocean's Network Canada, was discovered when a trawl fisherman brought up a chunk of solid methane hydrate in his net (DFO, 2018). This indicates that cold seep features may be vulnerable to impacts from bottom contact fishing and, as we don't know where they are, they remain unprotected. This is an important gap in our understanding of Pacific benthic ecosystems, which could be remedied with systematic multibeam mapping of the region. In addition to locating cold seeps, multibeam mapping would yield other important benefits because the data are broadly useful for marine spatial planning and monitoring of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (Brown et al., 2012). Multibeam maps can be used to help locate and quantify benthic landscape features and ecological processes for conservation prioritization and can be used to build species distribution models for species of concern e.g. sessile species like corals and sponges (Brown et al., 2012; Proudfoot et al., 2020).  Systematic multibeam mapping would also allow Oceans to ensure new MPAs  (established to meet conservation targets of 25% by 2025 and 30% by 2030) are sited so that the resulting networks are representative of the full diversity of habitats within the Pacific Region (Proudfoot et al., 2020).

If a Swiftsure Bank MPA or OECM is established, the biophysical and ecological overview will also inform the development of a management plan, as well as monitoring protocols and strategies.  Further, the information requested will contribute the body of knowledge available to departmental decision makers and may be considered along with consultations with First Nations, other partners, and stakeholders to inform management actions and measures, to address urgent threats to the critically endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales (SRKW), future areas of scientific research and monitoring, and engagement and co-delivery of programs with stakeholders and Indigenous groups.","The broader SRKW recovery initiative has had significant interest and involvement from public, media, stakeholders, First Nations, and governments at all levels (Transport Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Parks Canada, BC provincial and municipal governments, and US Federal and Washington State governments).

Identifying EBSAs is now a first step in the creation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) designated under the Oceans Act (DFO 2010). This approach is in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD 2008), and was re-emphasized in Canada's National Framework for Canada's Network of Marine Protected Areas (DFO 2011). EBSAs will also help inform marine planning initiatives managed by other federal and provincial departments/agencies—such as spill response activities, resource extraction, and marine shipping. Although marine EBSAs have been identified across the Pacific Region, the methodology, criteria used, and age of the underlying data used to inform EBSAs in the Southern Shelf and Strait of Georgia Bioregions (SSB & SOGB) is most in need of an update. The scientific knowledge used to identify the EBSAs in the SSB & SOGB is also more than 10 years old—despite DFO Science’s recommendation that EBSAs be re-evaluated every 5 years (DFO 2011). This compares to data in the Northern Shelf Bioregion (NSB) and Offshore Bioregion that are 3 and 5 years old, respectively. Additionally, the processes that identified EBSAs in the Offshore Bioregion (DFO 2016) and NSB (Clarke and Jamieson 2006a,b; DFO 2018) used newer, empirical-based methodologies instead of the older, expert-based Delphic process used in the SSB & SOGB (Jamieson & Levesque 2014; Levesque & Jamieson 2015. Finally, EBSAs identified in the SSB and SOGB relied on criteria developed by DFO (DFO 2014), and did not integrate criteria developed by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD 2008). As a signatory party of the CBD, Canada has committed to adopting these new scientific criteria for identifying EBSAs.The Oceans Program sees this process as mirroring RSIA #2014OCN01 which led to the reassessment of EBSAs in the Northern Shelf Bioregion (DFO 2018) using a standardized methodology that is consistent among all sites and bioregions and integrates newly-developed CBD criteria. End-users of this work will include Government of Canada staff involved in planning and implementing  various marine conservation tools—including Oceans Act MPAs and marine refuges by DFO, National Marine Conservation Areas by Parks Canada, and Marine National Wildlife Areas by Environment and Climate Change Canada. This science advice will also inform broader DFO initiatives related to marine spatial planning, species at risk, fisheries management, and marine spill response. Stakeholders and First Nations will use this information to participate in marine conservation processes. Given the importance of EBSAs in marine planning initiatives across the Pacific Region, science information and advice is needed so that this foundational knowledge is consistent, up-to-date, and as accurate as possible. A reassessment of SSB & SOGB EBSAs will ensure that marine spatial planning and oceans management decisions continue to be based on the best available science. With a limited amount of ocean area to protect, updated EBSA science will give federal and provincial decision makers the information they need to effectively manage ecologically and biologically significant species, habitats and/or ecosystems.

In Pacific Region, numerous First Nations and stakeholders have interests in marine ecosystems and resources, and the negotiations and consultations required to push forth an MPA can take decades. Given these constraints, the amount of space that DFO can protect is limited; protecting one area of ocean may come at the cost of protecting another area. In order to make the best use of the space, time, and resources that Canada has to conserve its marine ecosystems, it is imperative that decision-making is grounded in consistent and up-to-date science. If Science advice is not provided, management decisions may be based on EBSA information and criteria that are out-of-date and/or inconsistent. As a result, ecologically and biologically significant species, habitats and/or ecosystems may be negatively affected by a lack of appropriate protections.If Science advice is not provided, it will have a negative impact on our relationship with stakeholders. To date, DFO’s marine conservation efforts have resulted in mixed reaction by the public. There is ongoing criticism by external stakeholders of how MPA sites are chosen, and the scientific basis for their selection. As Canada moves to meet its domestic and international marine conservation targets—protecting 25% of Canada’s marine and coastal areas by 2025, and working towards protecting 30% by 2030—consultations and negotiations with stakeholders will become increasingly difficult.

Recent science provided by the Upper Columbia White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative (UCWSRI), which oversees the recovery efforts, and science provided through DFO SARP/BC Hydro contracting has indicated that survival of hatchery-origin fish has been higher than originally predicted, that survival is not equal across maternal families, and that carrying capacity may have been reached. Given the large number of hatchery-origin juveniles in the system (>10,000; vs. ~1000 wild adults), new allowable harm estimates specific to hatchery-origin juveniles are needed.BC Hydro and US partners maintain a long-term data set (annual spring and fall stock assessment) which should be adequate to complete these analyses.",Paul Grant (TBD other),"DFO SARP and FFHPP have been asked on numerous occasions (e.g., by industry, First Nations) to re-evaluate allowable harm for juvenile White Sturgeon, which are believed to have reached carrying capacity within the Canadian portion of the Upper Columbia River.

Longer term, the advice could also inform decision-making on a limited FSC harvest of juvenile White Sturgeon if deemed it could be done without risking conservation of the population or any wild White Sturgeon (beneficial use is an objective of the recovery strategy but can only be authorized through an exemption in an amended recovery strategy if it is consistent with conservation; so, it would not be a short-term action following science advice).

This will address conservation measures in the draft Management Plan for the North Pacific Humpback Whale, including: participating in transboundary research initiatives to improve the understanding of North Pacific Humpback Whales and continue to adapt management approaches for humpbacks as newer information on population structure, prey requirements, threats and effective mitigation becomes available.","Given the increased public attention on Humpback Whales (as recent calving rates increase, as well as recent entanglement and vessel strike reports), and recent requests for information related to harvest, a better understanding of population structure can help the Department evaluate specific areas where more proactive and directed management is required, given their spatial overlap with human activities (e.g. areas of high fishing activity and vessel traffic).

Further (updated) science advice will help advance national discussions on regulatory issues associated with critical habitat protection for wide-ranging marine species.","The questions that needs to be answered by Science are: What geographic area(s) and functions, features, and attributes support the survival and recovery of Transient Killer Whales in Canadian Pacific waters? Do recent data (2011-present) suggest that changes are warranted to the currently identified critical habitat functions, features, and attributes? Are there additional areas (or fewer areas) considered critical to the survival or recovery of this threatened population?In 2013, science advice identifying areas of special importance to the threatened Transient Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) in Canadian Pacific waters were provided through the CSAS process (see Ford et al. 2013). This advice pertained specifically to those Transients showing the most fidelity to inner coast waters (i.e., what were referred to as 'inner coast Transients' in Ford et al. 2013). Insufficient data were available to identify areas of special importance to those Transients showing less fidelity to coastal waters, and therefore less frequently encountered ('outer coast Transients'). A geographic area (3 nautical miles extending off the entire British Columbia coast) and functions, features, and attributes critical to the survival and recovery of inner coast Transient Killer Whales were identified in the previous science advice.Since the previous science advice was received, there has been a marked increase in the number of documented encounters with Transient Killer Whales, primarily in inner coast waters, including in the Salish Sea where threats to Transients (e.g., acoustic and physical disturbance) are recognized to be high. This encounter data is currently being used by the Cetacean Research Program (CRP) to inform an updated population status assessment for Transient Killer Whales (see RSIA 2019SAR02), and is therefore readily available to the CRP to inform updated science advice on critical habitat for this population. Data include encounter data collected during DFO surveys  as well as sightings data provided by external organizations and individuals (i.e., effort and non-effort-corrected data, respectively).Analysis of individual Transient Killer Whale encounter/sightings data (including predation events) and acoustic data alongside recent pinniped population data from the Pinniped Research Program (PRP) is requested in support of advice for critical habitat identification and should follow the current ""SARA Operational Guidelines for the Identification of Critical Habitat for Aquatic Species at Risk"".","Thomas Doniol-Valcroze, Cetacean Research Program (CRP), DFO Science","Critical habitat is identified under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) as ""the habitat that is necessary for the survival and recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as such in a final Recovery Strategy or Action Plan for the species"" (SARA s.2(1)). Sections 41(1)(c) and 49(1)(a) of SARA require ""an identification of the species' critical habitat, to the extent possible, based on the best available information"" in a recovery strategy and/or action plan for a threatened or endangered species. Transient Killer Whales are listed under SARA as threatened (since 2003), and although the draft amended Recovery Strategy does contain a draft partial critical habitat, data used to identify this critical habitat were from 1990-2011. Significant data collected from 1990-2011 and since 2011, and analyzed using quantitative methods, could allow a refinement of and/or suggest additions to, the draft critical habitat. As stated in the Directive on identifying critical habitat for aquatic species at risk, 'identification of critical habitat... may be an iterative process'; 'as new information regarding critical habitat becomes available, it will be incorporated through amendments to the species' recovery strategy'. Provision of this advice will inform ongoing (since 2016) engagements and consultations on  critical habitat with Wildlife Management Boards (WMBs), Indigenous groups, stakeholders and other levels of government, and will facilitate internal discussions on critical habitat operationalization within SARP. It will also allow the Species at Risk Program (SARP) to amend the recovery strategy, as needed, with a critical habitat identification based on the best, updated data, thereby allowing the Department to meet the legal requirements of critical habitat identification and protection.","Identification of critical habitat for SARA-listed species is a requirement under the Act.  Subsequent protection of critical habitat via a Critical Habitat Order (CHO) is a vital component of survival and recovery and a primary means of addressing habitat-related threats to the species, including contaminants, acoustic & physical disturbance, and prey availability.Updated science advice will greatly facilitate ongoing engagements and consultations on the critical habitat with WMBs, Indigenous groups, stakeholders and other levels of government.","2024-03-31 03:00:00","While there is no legal requirement to finalize the draft amended Recovery Strategy for Transient Killer Whale within a certain time frame, the public is very aware of the draft critical habitat included in the amended Recovery Strategy due to a regional consultation held in 2016 and a regional 'check-in' engagement initiated in 2021.

This request builds on internal discussions that took place between DFO Fisheries Management and Science  in June 2020 about exploring existing Groundfish sampling data from the last ~10 years across gear types and areas to identify gaps in sampling coverage for species for which biological information on catch is required (e.g., for assessments).","Greg Workman (Groundfish Science Section Head)(Steven Schut A/Groundfish Science Section Head), Luke Rogers (Aquatic Science Biologist)","The approach to biological sampling for groundfish species was last reviewed approximately 15 years ago. Since that time, there have been substantial changes to the characteristics of groundfish fleets, the relative abundance of stocks including the emergence of ""choke point"" stocks, and the demands placed on Science for advice in support of management decisions.  The advancement of spatial planning (e.g., marine zoning) has increased the complexity of obtaining biological samples from commercial, recreational and First Nations fisheries.  Furthermore, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced changes to at-sea monitoring for groundfish trawl fisheries that introduced at-sea Electronic Monitoring (EM) in lieu of the At-Sea Observer Program (ASOP).  These changes mean that the existing sampling strategies may not be well matched to current constraints and requirements.  Biological sampling of fisheries is vital to estimating key stock assessment components such as recruitment strength, productivity, growth and gear selectivity; all these components are required to provide science advice in support of sustainable fisheries management.","If the objectives and priorities for biological sampling are not well-matched to the requirements for Science advice then it is expected the quality of the advice will erode, creating risks to stocks and dependent fisheries from increased uncertainty in estimates of current status and future prognosis.  Articulation of priorities for biological sampling, and the requisite sampling effort is needed to (a) identify required resources and (b) anticipate resource gaps to inform strategic science and management planning.

In a MSE process, sustainability of harvest strategies is evaluated by simulation testing alternative management procedures against data generated by OMs that represent a range of hypotheses about uncertain stock and fishery dynamics.  The ongoing development of the Sablefish OM can serve as a framework for contexts where advice is generated by simulation-evaluation by illustrating methods for (a) identifying key uncertainties, (b) characterizing stock status, and (c) generating realistic stock and fishery monitoring data.","A Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for the commercial Sablefish fishery has been in place since 2008.

What are the impacts of  proposed new spatially explicit protections in the NSB MPAn on current science advice? How should these protections be considered in future stock assessments and harvest management control measures across fisheries in the Pacific Region (e.g. required changes to survey design due to potential prohibitions in protected areas, adjustments to management control measures such as TAC and/or effort distribution)?","Initial scoping meetings held with: Emily Rubidge, Carrie Robb, Dana Haggarty, Sarah Dudas","This advice is required to support the Government of Canada commitment to increasing the conservation of Canada’s oceans to 25 per cent by 2025, working towards 30 per cent by 2030.  This science advice will assist the department in identifying potential impacts of these spatially defined protections on departmental science advice, including stock assessments, as well as how we factor the resulting change into future coast-wide management decisions.

This advice may also contribute to ways in which fisheries management and science plan for and adopt measures related to other future MPAn processes within the Pacific Region, and possibly other regions.","In the absence of this advice, DFO will not be able to able to fully assess the impacts of the NSB MPAn on how these protections will impact the broader management of fisheries, and thus our obligations under our various mandates. This will affect our ability to meet our mandate for conservation, and may have negative impacts on stakeholders (primarily Commercial and Recreational Fishing) if benefits remain unaccounted. We anticipate further discussions from the Commercial sector, including Ministerial correspondence as well as media.

Fisheries Management conducted a review of the current (2021) proposal for the NSB MPAn in July 2021, which results included anticipated significant impacts to fisheries, and risk to meeting our obligations under the Fisheries Act and various international and First Nation Treaties. Additionally, impacts to stakeholders (primarily the Commercial and Recreational Fishing Sector)are largely managed by DFO, and are anticipated to be both negative (loss of access, displacement etc.) and positive (spillover effect, improved ecosystem resilience).","2022-12-31 04:00:00","This advice is required to support Government of Canada commitments to increasing the conservation of Canada’s oceans to 25 per cent by 2025, working towards 30 per cent by 2030.

Do factors such as tow speeds, water depths and time of year impact the level of damage caused by Scallop dragging activity?","Elizabeth Coughlan
DFO Science 
Shellfish Biologist","Newfoundland's lobster fishery has grown in importance in recent years, quickly becoming its 3rd most valuable species, and the landed value was upwards of $82M in 2021. Lobster is also the 2nd most important fishery in 3Ps and it reached a record of $28M in landed value this past season.

In recent years some serious concerns were raised by Lobster harvesters about the impact of Scallop dragging activity on their lobster fishing grounds. DFO responded between 2016 and 2019 by closing various shallow water areas (less than 20 fathoms) in the eastern portion of Fortune Bay to Scallop dragging. These closures have resulted in a shift of fishing effort to other parts of 3Ps (western Fortune Bay, Hermitage Bay, Connaigre Bay) which led to recent request from industry to close all areas North of 47N to scallop dragging due to concerns about the destruction of Lobster habitat in those areas. 

The science advice provided will help Resource Management make informed decisions on this matter:  should the areas closed be maintained, reduced or increased; are current closures based on water depth effective; what other types of closures could be possible (based on time of year, vessel speed,etc)?

Data will be shared with fish harvester committees, the FFAW, processors, Indigenous organizations and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador during the next 3Ps Lobster advisory, which is likely to take place in late November 2022.","Many questions were raised about Scallop dragging during the 2019 Lobster advisory in 3Ps and there was a request for more research to be done on this topic by Lobster harvesters.

A scientific review of the subject would provide an expert opinion that would facilitate common understanding and identify future research needs.  With the recent changes to Fisheries Act and the departments movement towards more integrated Fisheries Management, there are increasing questions regarding cage culture effects on wild fish populations and ultimately aquaculture impacts on commercial, recreational and aboriginal fisheries will  need to be known.  Recommendations coming out of the Cohen Inquiry indicate the department has responsibility/obligation to study and manage cage aquaculture and wild fish interactions.

Alaska has also adopted this estimate for their assessments and relies on Canada to conduct updates as the population summers in Canadian waters. The last aerial survey was conducted in 2007-2009 and did not cover belugas in estuaries. In addition, recent tagging data show that belugas cover a larger area (i.e., larger distribution) than what was covered in previous surveys. Following the 2017 stock assessment CSAS review, one of the main conclusions was that a new population abundance estimate was desperately needed and that it would be difficult to say at this point if the population is stable without an updated survey and survey design.

A modern, reliable screening tool for this purpose is currently under development by the Department (led by DFO-NL scientist, Dr. Ian Bradbury). 
Better tools will inform the Introductions and Transfers Committees to evaluate the genetic risks and mitigate the impacts associated with the transfers of finfish. For example, there is a need for a genetic tool to identify Atlantic salmon with non-American genes to restrict their introduction in Atlantic Canadian waters. The tests, tools and indicators would be applicable to other regions seeking to reduce specific genetic interactions in new sites and with the introduction and transfers process.",DFO Maritimes Science Staff,"Recent DFO study, using population genomics to explore the presence of European introgression into North American farmed Atlantic salmon suggested that some farmed Atlantic salmon have been significantly interbred with European salmon, and that some of these individuals have escaped and hybridized in the wild in Atlantic Canada. The presence of European genes in aquaculture salmon in North America is not new. Research into the impacts of farmed salmon interactions with wild salmon has been ongoing for a number of years. Recent advances in DNA analysis allow for enhanced screening and highly accurate information on frequency of European genetic contributions.

A current study, led by DFO scientist Dr. Ian Bradbury, shows that approximately one quarter of North American farmed salmon sampled in Atlantic Canada had a portion of their DNA attributable to recent interbreeding with European-origin domestic salmon. In Newfoundland and Labrador, European genes were detected in wild salmon sampled in areas around aquaculture sites, indicating the source to be aquaculture escapees with European genes that have interbred with wild Atlantic salmon. No permits have been issued to the aquaculture industry in Newfoundland and Labrador to import reproductively viable European fish for use in marine cages.
•	We have a significant amount of evidence that tells us interbreeding is occurring among wild and escaped farmed Atlantic salmon. This is genetically altering wild salmon and reducing population viability.
•	Past studies have reported significant levels of the presence of European genetic material in farmed Atlantic salmon and escapee samples in eastern North America, but the full extent and potential for impact on wild salmon remains unclear.
•	Here we build on previous work comparing North American and European salmon populations using genomic analysis of a wide range of wild salmon samples, and samples of farmed salmon and escapees from Atlantic Canada
•	Analysis of samples of North American farmed salmon showed evidence that around 17% had significant portions of their DNA (>5%) attributable to recent interbreeding with European salmon, and we detected several individuals with between 20-40% European ancestry.  
•	Similarly, analysis of individuals collected in the wild revealed several North American-European hybrid individuals near aquaculture cages in the Bay of Fundy and Southern Newfoundland 
•	Overall, our results suggest that some farmed Atlantic salmon have a significant proportion of recent European ancestry, and some of these individuals have escaped and bred with wild salmon in Atlantic Canada.  
•	Ongoing work is examining the impacts of escaped farmed salmon on wild populations in Atlantic Canada and developing tools for monitoring and traceability of escaped farmed salmon.","While aquaculture has been indicated as the potential source for European genes found in wild fish in Newfoundland and Labrador, there have been no permits issued to the provincial aquaculture industry to import reproductively viable European fish for use in marine cages. 
There is a need for science to proactively inform the aquaculture industry as it develops/evolves rapidly in the region to ensure the conservation of Wild Atlantic Salmon populations and genetic integrity. There is an increased interest in new finfish site development in Nova Scotia and in production increases in New Brunswick. If tools are not available for testing, we risk continued stocking of aquaculture sites within fish of European origin, which could escape and impact wild populations through introgression and hybridization. 

- Aquaculture has been a highly-publicized activity in Canada. It is generally supported as a source of economic development in rural areas but a growing number of salmonid and other interest groups are expressing criticism of the industry. If we do not address genetics, criticisms to the Department will increase and wild salmon will be at risk.
- The DFO genetics research will likely draw attention to the potential risks from salmon aquaculture to wild salmon populations, as well as criticism of the planned expansion of aquaculture in Atlantic Canada, including Newfoundland and Labrador. Increased calls to move to land-based aquaculture operations, similar to British Columbia, are expected.
- The research results indicate the aquaculture industry may have contravened federal/provincial restrictions by importing and maintaining or breeding salmon of European origin and this would go unaddressed.
- Criticism of the industry and government is expected, including of the actions of the Department. The groups may also question the adequacy of measures in place in to prevent/control escapes of farm salmon.

Long term monitoring is required to assess the effectiveness of the MPA in protecting the conservation objectives and any resultant potential benefits to other key species of interest and marine biodiversity.
Assessing the effectiveness of the MPA will require monitoring of various parameters and indicators within it as well as external reference sites through Before-After-Control-Impact design. The monitoring required will be focused on six conservation objectives (COs) including sea pens, northern wolffish, black dogfish, smooth skate, porbeagle sharks, and leatherback sea turtles.
Reference site selection should consider habitat, depth, oceanographic conditions, and amount of fishing activity. Largely dependent on life history characteristics, distribution and movements of key species, areas could include both adjacent reference sites and sites that are farther from the MPA. The identification of reference sites may not be possible for some COs, in which case an alternative approach can be recommended. Reference sites for overall biodiversity will be challenging but identifying similar areas with similar metrics may be
possible. Pre-closure fishing history in the areas should also be considered.",Dale Richards,"Monitoring is an essential component of the management cycle of MPAs.

In total, 10 belugas were live-captured and instrumented with back-mounted transmitters following standard methods. The program was highly successful, with tags reporting data between 14–356 days. The following year, an additional 20 EBS belugas were tagged using the same protocols, the same tags, and virtually an identical field crew. However, eight whales were confirmed dead based on the mortality function from a secondary pop-up archival tag, along with the discovery of three beachcast carcasses of tagged belugas. A further eight belugas had tags go offline within the same timeframe as those confirmed dead, with no known cause. This represents a mortality rate of 40% percent based on confirmed cases, and potentially as high as 80% if the additional offline tags represent whales that died.  This level of mortality is without precedent in any small cetacean live capture program. Tagging belugas with methods used in this program (live capture with dorsal ridge attachment) is currently the only approach that provides movement data (both horizontal and vertical) over long durations (i.e. up to a year). The need for movement data for beluga and other arctic cetaceans remains high (e.g., for stock delineation) and is likely to increase due to changing climate, increased anthropogenic activities, and the need for more integrated marine spatial planning. Therefore, it is critical to fully understand factors that may have influenced the survival of tagged whales and to provide recommendations to avoid this outcome in future. 

To identify and assess likely cause(s) and/or contributing factor(s) in the mortality of tagged EBS beluga whales by applying a differential process and assigning levels of certainty for each factor. Specifically, to: 
1. Review and evaluate the role of tagging in the mortality events; 
2. Evaluate the role of underlying health condition(s) in the mortalities using individual and population-level data;   
3. Determine if external factors (e.g., environmental) may have contributed to the mortalities

It is important to note that the CCAC Guidelines on the Care and Use of Marine Mammals is intended for Canadian institutions that house marine mammals in aquaria and is not relevant to live capture and tagging of wild animals for scientific study; the CCAC does not have guidelines for live capture and tagging for research purposes. 
The most recent paper by Andrews et al 2019 focuses on large whales rather than small cetaceans. While general guidance from Andrews et al. (2019) is applicable (e.g., sample size considerations), detailed guidance specific to small arctic cetaceans is not presented and is not publically accessible elsewhere.

The advice is specific to the incident that took place in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and specific to beluga whales. We recognize that a Zonal meeting may be applicable for O&P and Quebec.

Ongoing collection of TKW encounter and photo-identification data by DFO and collaborators has led to updated photo-identification catalogues; however, a population estimate for TKW has not been completed since Ford et al. (2009) and understanding of the TKW population has changed significantly since that time.

This science advice is required for ongoing management of TKW in Canadian Pacific waters. The updated population assessment can inform the habitat, prey and energetic requirements of TKW and can help to inform a quantitative recovery goal for this population.

Additionally, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) re-assessment on the species is anticipated to occur in November 2020. As a data collector and repository for information on aquatic species at risk, it is standard practice for DFO to provide the best available information to COSEWIC so that they can conduct a thorough and complete assessment. 

End users for this information include DFO's Species at Risk Program, Fisheries Management Branch, Marine Mammal Response Program, academia and the general public.","TKW are listed as Threatened under the Species at Risk Act, and an updated population assessment is required for effective management of this population, and to assess progress towards the meeting the population, distribution, and recovery objectives identified in the TKW Recovery Strategy.

Additionally, an updated population assessment for TKW could have management implications for other marine mammal species. The Department has received recent proposals to initiate a harvest of pinnipeds (the primary prey of TKW) in Canadian Pacific waters. A reduction in prey via consumptive use or culling could result in a lack of food for TKW, and is identified as a potential threat in their Recovery Strategy. Efforts to ensure that any future pinniped harvest would not impact TKW populations would be compromised if this science advice is not provided.","2023-03-31 03:00:00","Timely receipt of this information is required to ensure consistent and effective implementation of the SARA Recovery Strategy for the Transient Killer Whale in Canada, to inform the upcoming COSEWIC assessment, and, if required, can inform a Departmental response to requests to harvest Transient Killer Whale prey species.",1,"Not currently, but funding can be requested through the upcoming annual SARA work planning process.",2,Prioritization of the request was a guess as client did not indicate.,70,"2022-02-02 21:38:22.882032",,1964,1428,142,1555,,,2023,2022,4

Gaging the effectiveness of Marine Refuges (MRs) in protecting biodiversity and key species/ecological components of interest will require detecting changes between areas inside and outside the MRs.
Conservation Objectives (COs) identified for each MR will be the focus of monitoring plans. In addition, each closure has other potential benefits that will need to be assessed. Each MR is noted to provide biodiversity conservation benefits based on varying fishing gear prohibitions.
In the Hawke Channel and Funk Island Deep Closures, COs focus on Atlantic cod and benthic habitat. In the Hopedale Saddle, Northeast Newfoundland Slope, and Division 3O Coral Closures, COs focus on the protection of sensitive benthic areas.

These monitoring plans will support the regional deliverables under the 2021-2025 Pillar I Marine Conservation Target funding.

The QWB Request for Decision stated that “In the opinion of QWB, the current ‘summer-stock’ narwhal management is not evidence based, and contradicts generations of IQ” and requests a non-seasonal Baffin Bay population Total Allowable Harvest (TAH) as it applies to the communities of Baffin Island, rather than the current, specific TAHs for the Admiralty Inlet, Eclipse Sound, Somerset Island and East Baffin management units and the summering and migratory tag system. The Request for Decision also requests that the QWB allocate the revised TAH, establish a biennial forum for DFO to offer information and advice to QWB for tag allocations, continue the carry-forward policy, and enable Hunters and Trapper Organizations to use community tags in other areas (i.e. in other management units). The NWMB did not accept the amendment at that time, nor did the Minister when the QWB directly requested the amendments in October 2020. The QWB submitted a Request for Decision to the NWMB for consideration at their March 9, 2022 meeting regarding a revised proposal. The revised proposal includes using “the current seasonal Total Allowable Harvests (TAHs) for the waters of Northern and Eastern Baffin Island to determine a single amalgamated annual Basic Needs level (BNL) for Inuit in the six communities, together with the 2018 allocation of Somerset Island narwhal for Baffin Island HTOs”. The NWMB decided they are “not ready to modify the management system for Baffin Bay narwhal at this time. Furthermore, the NWMB understands and acknowledges concerns that assumptions used to determine narwhal stock boundaries and the harvest allocation model used in the 2012 integrated fisheries management plan (IFMP) for the Baffin Bay narwhal population do not reflect Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit for narwhal movement. The NWMB confirms its willingness to receive updates to the IFMP that address and accommodate these concerns.”","Without this advice, Fisheries Management cannot fully address the questions, or expectations of the Nunavut Narwhal Working Group and regional Hunters and Trappers Organizations regarding the implementation of the QWB-HTO proposal and implications for sustainability of harvest for the four Baffin Bay stocks.

Scientific knowledge relating to the effects of hatchery selection on the genetic variability of enhanced and wild salmon populations has  evolved significantly in recent years. The SEP guidelines were developed to minimize potential negative genetic impacts on target populations arising from hatchery practices. Recent research suggests that random broodstock collection & spawning protocols such as those employed by SEP may reduce reproductive fitness and increase earlier maturity of hatchery progeny (Ford et al 2012, Hayes et al 2012, California HSRG 2012). 

The SEP Broodstock Collection and Spawning Guidelines were developed in the 1980’s in an attempt to guide broodstock collection and spawning of Pacific salmon at SEP hatcheries and incubation facilities. Their goal is to manage genetic resources in a manner that preserves, as much as possible, the genetic integrity existing in any enhanced population. Recent advances in knowledge around hatchery selective pressures are not represented in the existing SEP genetic management guidelines and SEP is concerned that current practices may reduce reproductive fitness in hatchery-wild integrated programs. Hatchery programs have seen decreases in age of returning brood, reduced body size, lower fecundities, and smaller egg sizes. SEP requests advice from Science to update its genetic management guidelines to maintain genetic and phenotypic diversity in the target populations and to maximize effective population size. This information will be integrated into SEP operational practices and will update the departmental Risk Management Framework for Enhancing Pacific Salmon.

Specifically, SEP seeks Science review and guidance/advice to update the guidelines on the following topics:

1.    The existing guidelines recommend that jacks be used proportionally to their abundance in the population escapement. Many sites use 1:1 or a modified 1:1 spawning practice. Jacks, in the wild, are presumed to fertilize only a small proportion of the eggs of each female that they attempt to spawn with. Under current enhancement practices, genetic material from jacks may be disproportionately represented in progeny. If size and age at rerun are heritable traits, SEP is concerned that the proportionate use of jacks may be further driving selective pressures toward smaller and earlier maturing fish because of an unnaturally disproportionate influence under controlled hatchery spawning conditions. What advice does science provide on the use of jacks in the spawning structure given the above?

2.    SEP guidelines recommend against intentional selection of spawning pairs. Given more recent information regarding heritability of size and other phenotypic traits, are these recommendations still valid or should they be modified somewhat? 

3.    With an increasing number of younger fish returning, should SEP still be randomly crossing males and females or should crosses be predominantly made between same year classes; is there a risk that crossing between year classes is further reducing fish size, age at return, and fecundity?

4.    Recently, in some systems, significant differences have been seen in sex ratios, presumably largely due to fishing pressures. Where sex ratios are strongly skewed, are there modifications to standard spawning practices that should be implemented?
5.    Given the recent “Genetically Based Targets for Enhanced Contributions to Canadian Pacific Chinook Salmon Populations” document, are the SEP guidelines recommending removal of no more than 30% of the escapement for brood still viewed as an appropriately conservative approach?

6.    Where hatchery programs mark a proportion of their releases, is the target of the inverse of hatchery fish to wild fish in the returns relative to their use in spawning still appropriate? (i.e. 50% wild return, therefore 70% of fish used for spawning should be wild) Where hatchery programs only mark a proportion of their releases, should the marked fish use be similarly proportionally reduced?

7.    Some programs place the eggs from multiple females into a single container and use milt from an equal number of males to fertilize them. Is there a best practice that SEP should employ to reduce the risk of male dominance in fertilization?

8.    Some programs involve small numbers of releases that require very few pairs of fish for spawning purposes (many are rebuilding objectives). While matrix spawning is an obvious practice for conservation stocks, at what point should a facility employ matrix spawning and are there any recommendations as to best practices for matrixing?

9.    Relative to the above, where SEP removes 50% or more of the brood from a system for spawning purposes, what genetic safeguards should be implemented to reduce the risk of genetic risk?",-,-,"In the absence of advice from Science, the existing published guidelines will remain in place and continue to be used indefinitely. There has been increased scrutiny of DFO hatchery practices and their impacts on wild salmon populations and the current spawning practices may not properly align with current scientific knowledge of genetic risks of hatchery breeding programs. Without Science advice, there is an increasing potential for negative genetic impacts on at-risk salmon populations, both enhanced and non-enhanced.","2023-03-31 03:00:00",-,0,"",2,-,70,"2022-02-17 16:44:22.493086",,1969,1500,143,1500,,"2014SEP02",2024,2022,5

Technical interactions among species that co-occur in non-selective fishing gear are a defining characteristic of multi-species fisheries and, therefore, play a central role in multi-species fisheries management outcomes for individual species.

The ISE technique has long been known to be problematic and inaccurate (Wildish and Hargrave 2004, Cranford et al. 2017, Cranford et al. 2020). There has not been a better alternative until recently. An ultraviolet spectrophotometric (UVspec) method (Guenthur et al. 2011) has now been modified for application to aquaculture (Cranford et al. 2017, Cranford et al. 2020). Differences between these two methods can be substantial, especially in the upper ranges where the ISE method can underestimate actual impacts. Given different method sensitivities, the benthic organic enrichment classification  scheme used for regulatory compliance, based on Hargrave et al. (2008), needs revision before the UVSpec method can be employed in management frameworks. Even with revision of benthic impact thresholds the UVspec method appears more sensitive.

As of March 2019, Fisheries Management has implemented 17 bottom-contact fishing closures to protect glass sponge reefs in the Strait of Georgia and Howe Sound. A 150m boundary extending beyond each reef footprint was implemented as a precautionary measure due to a limited understanding of how suspended sedimentation from bottom-contact fishing impacts glass sponges. 

With reef-building glass sponge sediment sensitivity thresholds now available, these findings can be incorporated into the hydrodynamic Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) (CSAS 2018/042) for the Strait of Georgia glass sponge reefs to develop new exposure risk profiles and minimum buffer widths for all 17 reefs.

Please also include historical and projected stock biomass graphs.",--,"The most recent stock assessment for Pacific Cod (2018) recommended that the next assessment should occur (1) after the Management Procedure Framework  be reviewed through the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS), and (2) that any future updates to the current assessments should be done in years immediately following the biennial groundfish synoptic bottom trawl survey in each area (i.e., when the most recent survey index point is available). Due to COVID-19, the scheduled 2020 synoptic trawl survey in Area 3CD did not occur, but was conducted in 2021 and will again be conducted in 2022. However, updated biological information from the commercial fishery remains unavailable at this time and for the foreseeable future. The 2018 survey index in Area 3CD indicated a notable reduction in the index (approximately 25% of the previous two observations). The commercial CPUE index has also decreased since 2016. The 2020 update to the assessment noted that, assuming commercial catch is of a similar magnitude to the 2018 and 2019 catches (23 and 43 tonnes, respectively), the probability of the 2021 biomass being below the LRP is between 5% and 6% and the 2021 stock is projected to be in the Cautious Zone (below the USR) with greater than 99% probability under all 2020 catch scenarios tested, including zero catch. A critical concern with the 2020 assessment update was the lack of a West Coast Vancouver Island (3CD) synoptic survey update in 2020. It  recommended that this area be surveyed as soon as it was feasible, and that the advice be updated when the data are available. Since then, the 2021 survey index declined further. Another survey index point is expected in early fall 2022. Therefore a new assessment is recommended when the 2022 index is available.

This RSIA is staged in two connected steps:
STEP 1) An evaluation is requested to assess the potential impacts (and/or sensitivity) to the quality and rigour of anticipated scientific advice from missing biological data from the commercial fishery. The Pacific Cod Technical Working Group will be reconstituted to review this analysis and determine the significance of the impact. If deemed to not be of significance to the quality and rigour of the scientific advice, we would then proceed to step 2.

STEP 2) While recent Pacific Cod catch continues to be low, a 2022 update to the assessment is needed in order to incorporate recent (2021-22) survey information and consider changes in stock abundance in a timely manner. An updated assessment is also intended to evaluate the potential impacts of the lack of biological information from the commercial fishery may have on the advice. Updated harvest advice is required to determine if current harvest levels are sustainable and compliant with the Precautionary Approach.  This updated advice will help inform any required management changes in the continued absence of updated biological information from the commercial fishery. 

A completed pre-publication version of the 2022 updated assessment is required my management by November 7th 2022 (at the absolute latest) in order to be considered and included in the 2023/24 Groundfish Integrated Fishery Management Plan and consultation process.","Harvest advice is required to determine if current harvest levels are sustainable and compliant with the PA.

Species/Stock: 4T Winter flounder, 4T American plaice and 4T White hake - Stock trend; commercial biomass estimate for the three stock. - Status of stock in relation to biological reference points.
 
Provide status of indicators - Provide the area where there is the main concentration of each species (adult and juvenile) and at which depth.

Indicators (where applicable/available/appropriate): - Landings - Abundance indices from the trawl survey (average number and weight per tow) - Abundance indices from the sentinel fisheries - Weight at age where applicable

4T Winter flounder, 4T American plaice and 4T White hake have been in the critical zone of the PA since 2006, 1993 and 1995 respectively, and have been identified as a candidate species/stock to be listed under the amended Fisheries Act (C68). To address the eminent listing of those stocks, Gulf Region Resource Management is requesting science advice, not only to update the status and trend of the stocks, but also to address the need to develop rebuilding plans that are in compliance with the requirements outlined in the new fish stock provisions. Although the scope of the present advice request goes beyond that of a regular assessment for these stocks, there are commonalities between elements pertaining to a regular stock status/trend and those contained in an advice needed to develop a rebuilding plan. As such, Science may decide to partition this request in multiple assessments and review processes.

Introduction and Context - Briefly characterize the biology and environmental conditions affecting the stock. Communicate what is and is not known from an ecosystem perspective.

Description of Stock Status and Stock Trends - Provide estimated values of reference points, and estimate current status relative to all available reference points (Limit Reference Point, Upper Stock Reference, Removal Reference and Target Reference Point) including the stock status and fishery status zone of the fish stock.

- Describe stock status trends, and if applicable, any additional indicators of importance to the stock assessment (e.g., fishing mortality, age structure, sex ratio, size
distributions, etc.). 
- Assess the extent of spatial-temporal overlap between each of the stock and  and those of other commercially harvested species (e.g. Unit 1 redfish) in which incidental catch of each of those stocks is considered significant; 
- Determine if increasing catch legal size for each species could have an impact on current population trends; 
- Provide bycatch estimates for each stock in a future mobile-gear redfish fishery in Unit 1 based on 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000 t TAC, and determine whether the current decline in SSB is likely to intensify under any of the proposed harvest levels;

Probable Causes of the Stock’s Decline 

- Provide an overview of probable factors that have led to the decline of the species and/or those that may affect rebuilding (e.g., fishing mortality, non-fishing anthropogenic factors, biology of the stock, natural mortality, predator/prey interactions, environmental impacts including climate, oceanographic or ecosystem factors, habitat limitations). 

- Where possible, and relevant, identify the relative contribution of the probable causes to the decline, or those affecting or preventing rebuilding. Identify knowledge gaps. 

- Identify whether habitat loss or degradation is likely or unlikely to have contributed to the stock’s decline, given the current understanding of the best available evidence. If it is a probable cause, identify the type of habitat loss, its location(s), and how the stock uses the habitat. 

- Model the level of natural mortality and recruitment necessary to halt/reverse the declining;

Rebuilding Target and Timeline 

- Provide advice on candidate rebuilding targets for each stock, taking into account biology and the environmental conditions affecting the stock, and the desired probability of the stock being above the LRP (to be provided by fisheries management, when applicable) when the stock has achieved the rebuilding target; 
- Calculate, the time to rebuild to the rebuilding target in the absence of all fishing (Tmin). If this is not possible, provide an estimate of an alternative such as generation time, to be used by Fisheries Management in setting a rebuilding timeline;
- Provide advice to assist with expressing the rebuilding objective in a measurable way (consisting of a rebuilding target, timeline, and where applicable, a desired probability of management measures achieving that target in the given timeline);
- Provide advice on other measurable stock conservation objectives where applicable and feasible including the desired state, probability and time period to achieve the objective, where possible.

Management Measures Aimed at Achieving the Objectives and Science Advice to Support Socio-Economic Analysis

 - Advise on and evaluate the likelihood of potential management measures achieving the rebuilding objective, including habitat measures where applicable. Use decision or performance tables or graphics, if applicable; 
- Identify whether stocks are more likely to decline than grow under conditions of no fishing and, where applicable, when other management measures (e.g., habitat restoration, hatchery enhancement, etc.) are also unlikely to result in stock growth. - Provide quantitative projections or simulations of the stock’s response to proposed management measures. Where not possible, provide information on expected consequences (quantitative and/or qualitative) of the benefits and risks associated with the potential management measures;

Methods to Track Progress 

- Advise on how to measure progress (setting performance metrics) against the objectives to achieve the target, particularly those related to the stock’s status.

Periodic Review of the Rebuilding Plan 

- Advise on frequency of monitoring and assessment activities, including interim updates; 
- Advise on exceptional circumstances under which it may be desirable to invoke a sooner-than-planned review of the rebuilding plan, such as: changes to the stock assessment model(s), large changes in stock status, new information that significantly changes understanding of stock status or population dynamics, significant ecological changes (e.g.,
predators or prey), major environmental events, etc.",Jenni McDermid,"The information will be used by Resources Management as part of the development of FSP-compliant rebuilding plan for each of the stocks that are subject to this request, more specifically   to inform, provide guidance and validate rebuilding objectives, management measures and methods to track progress towards rebuilding and through periodic review, to help determine if changes are needed in order to further protect the stocks. 

The broad distribution of some of these stocks within the Gulf of St. Lawrence (i.e., 4T American plaice, 4T White hake), the management measures implemented under the rebuilding plans will, in most cases, have a limited, but in some cases, significant impact on the way the inshore, midshore, and offshore commercial groundfish fisheries are managed and conducted in all four DFO regions.","The main risk, if this science advice is not provided, would be failing to comply with the requirements set out under the new fish stock provisions for stocks in the critical zone.

4. Which real-time detection technology would be best for use in different parts of the SRKW Critical Habitat and/or the Pacific Region as a whole?
5. What management measures could be taken if a whale is detected in a narrow waterway vs open water?",This RSIA was submitted following preliminary discussions with DFO Science Staff; Harald Yurk and Sean MacConnachie.,"The need for enhancing a real-time detection of whales and implementing a notification system to vessels with currently employed Programs (i.e., CCG Marine Mammal Desk) has been raised by multiple stakeholders in discussion with GoC in the Pacific Region to help provide real-time response and mitigation when at-risk whales are present. Current near real time technologies and tools have significant limitations seasonally (such as WRAS) or are only applicable when an animal is vocalizing (e.g., acoustic detections). Exploring new and innovative technologies such as prediction and forecasting tools combined with infrared camera detections and/or acoustic detection methods will help to enhance the currently limited applications. 

An increasing number of real-time warning systems have been designed with the purpose of avoiding collisions between whales and vessels and limiting acoustic disturbances. The principle behind such warning systems is that whale sightings and acoustic detections are mapped in real-time in high-density traffic areas such as those associated with shipping lanes. However, the delay for a large commercial vessel (such as a ferry, cargo vessel or tanker) to change its path or adjust its speed in response to a whale may be long. If ship pilots could anticipate a few hours in advance, the reductions in collision risk and acoustic disturbance may be considerably improved.
 
The advice would also contribute to the implementation of recommended approaches to meet recovery objectives as identified in recovery documents for marine species at risk, including a high priority recovery measure in the Action Plan for the Northern and Southern Resident Killer Whale in Canada (Recovery Measure #34: real-time detection of acoustic disturbance (i.e., vessel disturbance in RKW critical habitat and implement a response mechanism to mitigate potential impacts).","The Minister of Fisheries, Oceans, and the Canadian Coast Guard and the Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada, as the Minister responsible for Parks Canada Agency, have formed the opinion that the Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW), is facing imminent threats to its survival and recovery. The Ministers each came to this opinion after reviewing an Imminent Threat Assessment that considered the biological condition of the SRKW population, ongoing threats, and mitigation measures. In October 2018, the DFO Minister committed to a suite of measures being put in place for summer 2019. A suite of regulatory and non-regulatory measures were put in place since 2019 and are designed to address the key threats to the SRKW population’s recovery. These, along with several other events, have resulted in increased scrutiny of DFO’s management of  SRKW and commitment to its recovery.  Given the finding of imminent threat and changes in behaviour of timing of arrivals to the Salish Sea, it has been a continued challenge to develop and communicate the real-time location of whales in an area 24/7 during summer and winter months. This advice is required to support management efforts and will also address comments raised from industry stakeholders who have continued to question the efficacy of management efforts when whales are not present. Not providing this science advice would mean that the a gap for real-time management is still not being addressed in the Pacific Region whereas work is already underway in areas in the east coast. Blunt force trauma of vessel strikes has been recently found by Dr. Raverty (2020) as being a cause for mortality in killer whales and is a continued, increasing as shipping is predicted to increase in the near future. Other baleen species will also likely be more susceptible to strike risk in areas of high shipping activity.

Cette demande vise le développement d’un protocole et de normes de suivi permettant d’évaluer l’efficacité des mesures de protection mises en place sur les objectifs de conservation. 

Afin de pouvoir déterminer l’évolution de ces habitats pour le homard et le hareng, le protocole devrait s’appuyer sur une caractérisation à jour des lagunes et de leur utilisation par le hareng et le homard. Ainsi, une mise à jour des données disponibles est nécessaire. De plus, les éléments clés à suivre (indicateurs) doivent être identifiés afin d’élaborer le protocole de suivi. Enfin, les méthodes d’échantillonnages choisies doivent être détaillées et adaptées au suivi de ces éléments clés.

Cet objectif découle de l’engagement du gouvernement du Canada envers les objectifs 2010 de la Convention pour la diversité biologique et est une priorité ministérielle inscrite dans la lettre mandat du ministre. Les refuges marins répondent à des engagements internationaux du Canada sur la conservation des aires marines et côtières (SMDD 2002, CBD 2004, Conférence des parties CBD 2010) qui inclus un suivi écologique adéquat avec un protocole précis, des indicateurs et des relevés.

Pour appuyer la gestion adéquate de ce refuge, des connaissances à jour sont nécessaires sur le hareng et le homard ainsi que leur environnement. Par exemple, les aires de répartition au sein des lagunes, la présence de frayères à hareng et les zones de forte densité de homard juvéniles devraient être précisés. Le suivi de l’évolution du hareng et du homard dans les zones ciblées permettra d’évaluer les mesures de protection mises en place.","Des évaluations des mesures de protection, vraisemblablement des zones de fermetures de pêches, seront réalisées en considérant les informations obtenues.

2) Inform the identification and prioritisation of area-based regulatory protection measures;
3) Inform the identification and prioritisation of mitigation actions and recommendations

The work will support the following departmental priorities and actions:

1) Delivery of Integrated Salmon Ecosystem Plans under PSSI;
2) Improved understanding of Salmon Ecosystems to make effective decisions and increase work in  
   Integrated Ecosystem Planning and Salmon Habitat Restoration (PSSI: Pillar 1, Theme B 
   sub-initiatives 3.1, 4.1 and 4.3); 
3) To restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the  
   benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity (Wild Salmon Policy);
4) Incorporate sound climate science in departmental decision making","The following consequences are anticipated in the event the science advice is not provided:

1) ISEPs are undermined by failure to incorporate credible climate science. Successful delivery  
   of ISEPs as a component of PSSI is not achieved;
2) Potential loss of restoration investments in the Thompson-Nicola due to a failure to  
   understand and incorporate future climate states (e.g. extreme weather events);
3)  Contribution to the continued decline of wild salmon populations in the Thompson-Nicola due to 
   failure to incorporate climate science in integrated planning processes.
4) Impact on First Nation resources and community sustenance in the Thompson - Nicola due to the  
   absence of a credible integrated planning approach.

Since the last assessment COSEWIC has updated their DU guidelines. The genetic information that previously supported the three DU structure is no longer sufficient under the updated guidelines for Discreteness and Significance. However, almost every Atlantic marine species looked at in recent years has more structure than previously believed, which is likely the case for American Plaice. Therefore new genetic analysis is now required to support an updated DU structure for American Plaice.","Providing science advice on population structure would allow COSEWIC to delay the reassessment of American Plaice, to ensure the DU structure and assessments are based on the best information available. Not providing science advice would likely result in COSEWIC proceeding with a reassessment of the species, which would result in a collapse of the existing DU structure (given there is no recent genetic data to support existing DU structure). Once genetic information were to become available, COSEWIC would likely reassess and potentially separate into multiple DUs once again. Rather than have the department spend a huge amount of time and effort on listing, consultation and recovery document development, for different COSEWIC assessment outcomes, it would be highly beneficial to provide science advice on the population structure of American Plaice to inform the next assessment. Therefore providing data/ science advice would be appropriate and would potentially avoid having COSEWIC backtracking on DU structure.","2024-03-31 03:00:00","It would take a year to collect samples and a year to run the samples and conduct the analysis and provide science advice.

Science advice will help advance national discussions on regulatory issues associated with critical habitat protection for wide-ranging marine species.","What geographic area(s) and functions, features, and attributes support the survival and recovery of 'outer coast' Transient Killer Whales in Canadian Pacific waters?","Thomas Doniol-Valcroze, Cetacean Research Program (CRP), DFO Science","Critical habitat is identified under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) as ""the habitat that is necessary for the survival and recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as such in a final Recovery Strategy or Action Plan for the species"" (SARA s.2(1)). Sections 41(1)(c) and 49(1)(a) of SARA require ""an identification of the species' critical habitat, to the extent possible, based on the best available information"" in a recovery strategy and/or action plan for a threatened or endangered species. 

In 2013, science advice identifying areas of special importance to the threatened Transient Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) in Canadian Pacific waters was provided through the CSAS process (see Ford et al. 2013). This advice pertained specifically to those Transients showing the most fidelity to inner coast waters (i.e., what were referred to as 'inner coast Transients' in Ford et al. 2013). Insufficient data were available to identify areas of special importance to those Transients showing less fidelity to coastal waters, and therefore less frequently encountered ('outer coast Transients'). A geographic area (3 nautical miles extending off the entire British Columbia coast) and functions, features, and attributes critical to the survival and recovery of inner coast Transient Killer Whales were identified in the previous science advice.

Since the previous science advice was received, there has been a marked increase in the number of documented encounters with Transient Killer Whales. Encounter data are currently being used by the Cetacean Research Program (CRP) to inform an updated population status assessment for Transient Killer Whales (see RSIA 2019SAR02) and is therefore readily available to the CRP to inform updated science advice on critical habitat for this population. Data include encounter data collected during DFO surveys as well as sightings data provided by external organizations and individuals (i.e., effort and non-effort-corrected data, respectively).

Analysis of individual Transient Killer Whale encounter/sightings data (including predation events) and acoustic data from Passive Acoustic Monitors (PAMs) alongside recent pinniped population data from the Pinniped Research Program (PRP) is requested in support of advice for critical habitat identification and should follow the current ""SARA Operational Guidelines for the Identification of Critical Habitat for Aquatic Species at Risk"".

Provision of this advice will inform ongoing (since 2016) engagements and consultations on critical habitat with Wildlife Management Boards (WMBs), Indigenous groups, stakeholders and other levels of government, and will be considered in internal discussions on critical habitat operationalization within SARP. It will also allow the Species at Risk Program (SARP) to amend the recovery strategy, as needed, with a critical habitat identification based on the best, updated data, thereby allowing the Department to meet the legal requirements of critical habitat identification and protection.","Identification of critical habitat for SARA-listed species is a requirement under the Act.  Subsequent protection of critical habitat via a Critical Habitat Order (CHO) is a vital component of survival and recovery and a primary means of addressing habitat-related threats to the species, including contaminants, acoustic & physical disturbance, and prey availability.

Killer Whales in Canadian Pacific waters are an iconic species that are valued by Indigenous peoples and members of the general public. Efforts by DFO to advance recovery of all populations are of high public interest since the recent attention to Resident Killer Whale recovery planning processes and CH identification. Science advice will facilitate ongoing engagements and consultations on the critical habitat with WMBs, Indigenous groups, stakeholders and other levels of government.","2025-02-01 04:00:00","While there is no legal requirement to finalize the draft amended Recovery Strategy for Transient Killer Whale within a certain time frame, the public is very aware of the draft critical habitat included in the amended Recovery Strategy due to a regional consultation held in 2016 and a regional 'check-in' engagement in 2021. Further delays in identifying and protecting critical habitat are likely to be scrutinized by the public, emphasizing the need for timely, updated science advice.

Le développement d'un PGIP pour le pétoncle des zones 16EF et 18A figure au plan de travail du CPD depuis 2022-2023. 

En 2017-2018, en réponse aux recommandations du rapport de la CEDD, le MPO a donné priorité à l'élaboration de plans de rétablissement pour 19 stocks de poissons, dont le stock de pétoncle des zones 16EF et 18A. Même si la situation de ces stocks est incertaine (étant donné l'absence de points référence), les diminutions de PUE observées au cours des dernières années et autres indicateurs laissent croire que les stocks des zones 16E et 16F ont été surexploités. Compte tenu des délais et échéanciers pour le développement des points référence et d'une approche de précaution, le ministère s'est engagé via le plan de travail du Cadre pour la pêche durable (CPD) 2022-2023, à commencer le développement d'un PGIP dans les zones 16EF et 18A. Le réalisé dans le cadre du développement d'un PGIP servira à alimenter le plan de rétablissement s'il est établi, via le développement des PRL, que ces stocks sont en zone critique. Il est à noter qu'il a été proposé que les stocks des zones 16E et 16F fassent partie du prochain lot de stocks visés par les dispositions sur les stocks de poissons de la Loi sur les pêches avec une entrée en vigueur à l'automne 2023. S'il est établi que les stocks sont en zone critique, le Ministère disposera d'un délai de 24 mois pour l’élaboration d’un plan de rétablissement, soit jusqu'à l'automne 2025.

Les PGIP sont des documents de planification ayant deux fonctions principales :
•	la désignation des enjeux, objectifs et mesures de gestion conçus pour assurer le déroulement ordonné de la pêche et pour veiller à ce que la pêche soit rentable, durable et avantageuse sur les plans social et culturel;
•	la communication, au sein du MPO et à l'intention des parties externes, des renseignements de base à propos d'une pêche donnée et de la gestion de cette pêche.
Ils servent aussi à rendre compte de l’application de la Loi sur les pêches et de ses règlements de même que de la mise en œuvre des politiques du MPO, dont celles du CPD. 
Une fois approuvés, les PGIP sont publiés sur le site Internet MPO : https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fisheries-peches/ifmp-gmp/index-fra.html.

Les plans de rétablissement sont des documents autonomes spécifiquement destinés à répondre aux exigences réglementaires, et la version approuvée sera mise à disposition sur le site Web du MPO. Le plan de rétablissement permettra de respecter les obligations de l’article 6.1 de la Loi sur les pêches [soit le paragraphe 6.1(1) ou 6.1(2)] jusqu’à ce que le grand stock de poisson prescrit atteigne sa cible de rétablissement. Une fois que le stock a atteint sa cible de rétablissement, le plan de rétablissement prend fin et les pêches du stock en question seront assujetties au PGIP ou à un autre plan de gestion du stock.","-Délais additionnels dans le développement de ce PGIP.

Or, les résultats des relevés acoustiques dans cette unité suggèrent une variabilité importante de la ressource au niveau temporel.

Afin de proposer des mesures de gestion qui permettront de protéger la biomasse reproductrice et qui favoriseront le recrutement, la gestion de la ressource, souhaite obtenir plus d’information concernant la dynamique de reproduction du stock de hareng 4S. Parmi les questions que nous avons nous souhaiterions savoir :
1. Quels sont les lieux et les périodes de frai des deux composantes (automne et printemps) dans cette zone et est-ce qu'il y a un chevauchement ? Les dates du relevé acoustique devraient-elles être modifiées pour tenir compte des changements potentiels dans les périodes de reproduction ?
2. Dans quelle proportion les individus de 4R contribuent à la reproduction du stock de 4Sw ? Ces deux stocks sont-ils génétiquement distincts, des flux migratoires peuvent-ils être identifiés ?",Kim Emond,"Cette demande a pour objectif général d'améliorer les connaissances scientifiques sur le stock de hareng de la zone 4S, lesquelles pourraient bonifier l'évaluation de ce stock et par conséquent les mesures de gestion. Actuellement, un total autorisé des captures (TAC) préventif est fixé pour cette ressource en l'absence d'informations scientifiques suffisantes. Avec les fermetures de pêche annoncées en 2022 pour le maquereau de l'Atlantique et le hareng de printemps du sud du Golfe du Saint-Laurent, la gestion a observé une augmentation de l'effort de pêche sur le stock de hareng de la zone 4S. L'amélioration des connaissances scientifiques pour ce stock permettrait ultimement de fournir des recommandations plus représentatives de son état réel.

De plus, bien que cette pêche soit encore effectuée en quasi-totalité dans la sous-division 4Sw en Basse Côte-Nord, un certain intérêt semble s'installer en Moyenne Côte-Nord pour participer à cette pêche.","Le hareng est considéré comme une espèce fourrage. Cette espèce joue un rôle clé dans l’écosystème du Saint-Laurent. Cette espèce est intimement liée à d’autres espèces de poissons de fond et de mammifères marins. À l'échelle de l'Atlantique Nord, plusieurs stocks de harengs se sont effondrés du fait d'une augmentation de la mortalité naturelle et du faible recrutement. Une bonne connaissance de la dynamique reproductrice de ce stock est nécessaire pour assurer une exploitation durable de ce dernier.","2024-03-31 03:00:00",Poursuite des travaux,0,"",3,"""1.

- Établir l’ordre de priorité des pêches aux fins d’évaluation (Étape 1)
- Évaluer le programme de surveillance (Étape 2) (incluant évaluation de la qualité/fiabilité des données, examen du risque et analyse des lacunes à l'aide des outils et guides disponibles).

En 2022-2023, la région a débuté, sur une base informelle, l’évaluation des programmes de surveillance des prises dans le cadre d’un atelier de travail qui a eu lieu à l’IML du 11 au 13 octobre 2022.

Nous sommes actuellement en attente des orientations nationales pour savoir quels stocks devront être priorisés par la région à compter de 2023-2024. Un plan de travail régional sera développé et partagé avec les directions/régions impliquées. Les livrables pour 2023-2024 seront précisés dans le plan de travail du Cadre pour la pêche durable 2023-2024.",-,"Le MPO a dirigé l'élaboration d'une politique de surveillance des pêches afin d'établir les objectifs et l'orientation de la surveillance des pêches dans les toutes les pêches de capture sauvage gérées par le gouvernement fédéral au Canada. Cette politique, adoptée en 2019, fait partie de la série de politiques du cadre pour la pêche durable (CPD) du Ministère. 

Il est essentiel de disposer d'informations solides sur la surveillance des pêches pour évaluer les stocks et mettre en œuvre efficacement des mesures de gestion telles que des limites de prises accessoires et cibles, des quotas et des zones fermées. L'information sur la surveillance des pêches est également nécessaire pour appuyer l'utilisation durable à long terme des ressources halieutiques à des fins alimentaires, sociales et rituelles et d'autres pêches autochtones, commerciales et récréatives, ainsi que pour appuyer l'accès aux marchés des produits du poisson canadiens. À l'échelle nationale et internationale, on met aussi l'accent sur l'amélioration de la surveillance des pêches pour appuyer la mise en œuvre d'une approche écosystémique de la gestion des pêches.

Une surveillance efficace des pêches est nécessaire pour atteindre les objectifs stratégiques du Ministère, notamment la Politique sur la gestion des prises accessoires (2013) et le Cadre décisionnel pour les pêches en conformité avec l'approche de précaution (2009). Ces deux politiques exigent la surveillance de toutes les pêches qui capturent ou interceptent un stock ou une population afin de rendre compte de l'ensemble des prélèvements effectués par les pêcheurs.

Depuis 2021-2022, une section spécifique à la mise en oeuvre de la Politique de surveillance des pêches a été incluse au Plan de travail du Cadre pour la pêche durable afin de rendre compte des engagements pris et des progrès réalisés par le MPO dans ce dossier. 
 
La lenteur du MPO à mettre en oeuvre la Politique de surveillance des pêches a été critiqué par Oceana Canada dans diverses publications (Audit des pêches 2021 https://oceana.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/Oceana-Canada-Fishery-Audit_FR_FINAL.pdf; Rapport de 2021 spécifique à la surveillance des pêches : https://oceana.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/fmp_report_final_0.pdf).

Depuis 2013, ce suivi des impacts dans les zones B et C prend la forme d’un relevé annuel post-saison dont la réalisation est assurée par lAssociation de gestion halieutique autochtone Mi’gmaq et Wolastoqiyik (AGHAMW) et les titulaires de permis. Conformément aux critères de participation établies dans le Plan de pêche axé sur la conservation (PPAC) du concombre de mer des zones B et C, tous les titulaires de permis de pêche exploratoire doivent, depuis 2013, participer à la réalisation du relevé post-saison afin d’être admissibles à l’émission d’un permis l’année suivante. Parmi les 4 titulaires de permis de concombre de mer dans les zones B et C se trouvent 3 Premières Nations (Nation Micmac de Gespeg, Micmacs of Gesgapegiag et Première Nation Wolastoqiyik (Malécite) Wahsipekuk), membres de l’AGHAMW, et un pêcheur allochtone. 

Depuis 2013, l’AGHAMW coordonne, à la demande des titulaires de permis, la planification et la réalisation du relevé post-saison. Un permis scientifique (article 52 du Règlement de pêche dispositions générales (RPdg) est émis annuellement à l’AGHAMW pour la réalisation de ce relevé. L’AGHAMW effectue l’ensemble des travaux d’échantillonnage, la collecte, la saisie et l’analyse de données et présente les résultats annuellement au MPO, sous la forme d’un rapport scientifique. 

En 2021, les objectifs du relevé post saison ont été révisés afin d’ajouter, au suivi des impacts, le suivi d’indicateurs d’abondance indépendants de la pêche et la collecte de données environnementales dans le but que les données puissent être éventuellement intégrées aux évaluations de stocks réalisées par les Sciences. 

Lors du Comité consultatif du concombre de mer de la CN en 2022, il a été proposé qu'un relevé similaire soit réalisés dans la zone 3. Les objectifs de ce relevé et la faisabilité n'ont cependant pas été discutés.

This request for science advice was originally submitted in 2018 by Jeremiah Young. Advice should be provided in the context of the peer-reviewed standardized protocol developed for Arctic Char stock assessments by DFO Science.",Ross Tallman and Adam O'Dell,"The Clyde River Hunters and Trappers Organization (HTO) made a request to the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) for an increase in the Arctic Char commercial quota of Sam Ford Fiord from 4500 kg to 9000 kg. The commercial Arctic Char quota identified in Schedule V of the Northwest Territories Fishery Regulations for Sam Ford Fiord is 3600 kg. Based on science advice provided by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) in 1995, the quota was varied to 4500 kg. In 1999, the Clyde River HTO requested the NWMB increase the commercial Arctic Char quota to 6800 kg. DFO advised that an increase to 6800 kg would be a high risk option for overfishing the stock. DFO identified a medium risk option (increase to 5500 kg) and a low risk option (remaining at 4500 kg). The NWMB approved an increase to 5500 kg, and the fishery was opened under Variation Order at that quota in 1999/2000. Since that time, the waterbody has been opened under Variation Order at quotas ranging from 3600-5500 kg. DFO advised the NWMB based on a review of the available information and 1999 science advice that there continues to be a moderate risk to the Arctic Char population in Sam Ford Fiord at a commercial harvest level of 5500 kg and a high risk to the population if the commercial quota was increased to 9000 kg. DFO recommended that the fishery should be monitored to assess the effect of the harvest levels and undergo a formal stock assessment of the Arctic Char population in Sam Ford Fiord. Fisheries Management requires Science to provide updated science advice on sustainable harvest levels and stock status, including whether or not the stock can support an increased quota. DFO would be the primary user of this information. However, some of the information will also be used by the NWMB, Government of Nunavut (GN) and local Hunters and Trappers Organizations (HTOs). Population abundance estimates and sustainable harvest levels are required to implement the Precautionary Approach in support of the Resource Management Sustainable Development Framework, which forms a foundation for an ecosystem approach and fisheries management decision making. This information is required as part of Integrated Fisheries Management Plans for Arctic Char in Nunavut. The provision of this information/advice is required to support departmental priorities: - DFO’s obligations in the High Arctic, in particular, implementing Article 16 of the Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area’s Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement. - Arctic Char fisheries are key fisheries in DFO Arctic Region, contributing significantly to economically prosperous maritime sectors and fisheries (modernization of the fisheries). - Sustainable commercial and exploratory fisheries support the development of commercial and emerging fishing activities in the North (responding to changing ecosystems, modernization of the fisheries).- Implementation of the Sustainable Fisheries Framework and the Fishery Decision-making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach are based on scientific information (responding to changing ecosystems).- Advice will be considered by stakeholders and fishing industry, deepening engagement and key partnerships.","Arctic Char fisheries will continue to be managed without sustainable harvest level recommendations, existing quotas may not be appropriate, and exploratory fisheries may not be fully developed. Inappropriate harvest levels (management decisions) including the absence of sustainable harvest level recommendations could negatively affect the species and the ecosystem. Arctic Char fisheries include participants from federal and territorial government agencies, industry, and community resource users and stakeholders. Without Science advice, there is a risk that DFO will be unable to manage expectation and maintain confidence of participants, potentially leading to the loss of partnerships. Specifically, DFO Science advice will be considered by the NWMB (co-management organization) in providing recommendations to the Minister. The NWMB and community of Clyde River have requested that this stock be assessed; therefore, if science advice is not provided, DFO would not be honouring the requests of co-management partners.","2025-04-01 03:00:00","2018 was the commencement of data collection towards completing a minimum 5-year stock assessment with an RAP not expected until at least 5 years of data collection is complete. 2022 was the 5th year of data collection required under DFO's Emerging Fishery Protocol.

Using the current framework (2017), which in broad terms aims to evaluate the effects of human-induced mortality on eel productivity and biodiversity at both the regional and local (e.g., individual watershed) scales, a stock assessment is required every 5 years applying the recommended principle of stock status (running median abundance for the East River-Chester elver recruitment index), regardless of if a re-assessment earlier than the proposed five-year assessment schedule may be warranted (i.e., if 3-year running mean of the elver recruitment index for East River-Chester falls below 2.33 kg/km^2). A full stock assessment was last carried out following the 2018 fishing season. Therefore, a full stock assessment is now required to take place following the 2023 fishing season in advance of the 2024 fishery.

Specific science information and/or advice requested: (i) What fishery-dependent and fishery-independent time series can be used or further developed to assess trends in status of American eel and eel fisheries? Time series of particular interest continue to include commercial logbooks for eels and elvers, salmonid electrofishing bycatch, and the East River Chester index of total elver run size and commercial elver harvest levels; Additionally, beginning in 2022 recreational eel fishers are now required to annually report catches in the freshwater fisheries monitoring document and submit logs to the Department; (ii) What proportion of the total freshwater productive area for the American eel in Maritimes Region is exploited by harvest fisheries, both large eel and elver, now that Indigenous participation/access is increasing? What is the footprint relative to the area impacted by hydroelectric facilities and dams and what at what level of productivity is impacted in those areas due to unsafe downstream passage or inefficient upstream passage; (iii) What is the current extent of spatial overlap of the large (yellow and silver) and small (elver) eel fisheries and at what level can this occur at before there is a medium to high risk of the stock declining; (iv) Are there river systems that can support increased elver harvesting above the 400 kg river catch ca?",DFO Science staff are not currently available.,"This advice will be used to manage the elver fishery. Current stock assessments are completed every 5 years, regardless of whether an assessment update is triggered as a result of the index river estimate decreasing three years in a row (below the long term mean). The last stock assessment was carried out in 2018. 2023 will mark the 5-year timeline for a full stock assessment to occur using the current framework.","The elver fishery has drawn scrutiny from Indigenous communities/groups and the public due to the status of the species. 

It is essential that fisheries management decisions are based on science advice in order to inform fisheries management decisions related to conservation of the resource, distributing access, and determining allocations. American eel abundance has decreased substantially across its Canadian range in the last 40 years. Despite observed increases in elver abundance in the Maritimes Region index river in recent years, there are serious conservation concerns given the overall population decline and pending SARA listing.","2023-09-30 03:00:00",Science advice is required in advance of decision(s) on the 2024 fishery.

DFO currently limits the shrimp trawl fishing opportunities for the WCVI (PFMA 121, 23, 123, 124, and 125) based on a maximum eulachon bycatch limit of 4 t.  If this 4 t limit is reached, the commercial fishery is closed for the remainder of the season.  This 4 t limit was a limit set by resource management in the absence of science advice.   In 2022 DFO Pelagic Science is working on analysis of the offshore eulachon data collected during the annual spring DFO multi-species biomass survey conducted off the WCVI, as well as other available data.   DFO Science is expecting to be able to produce eulachon population biomass estimates for the WCVI based on this data beginning in late 2022.   Resource Management does not currently have science advice on setting appropriate biologically-based eulachon bycatch limits (or allowable harm limits) for the commercial fishery.
Resource Management is seeking advice on setting biologically-based bycatch allowances or removal rates for eulachon populations off the WCVI.   Resource Management is seeking advice on what range of percentages of the estimated WCVI eulachon could be harvested as bycatch without severely impacting Fraser River eulachon sustainability.  Seeking a range of low, moderate, and higher risk options for eulachon removal rates.","Drafts of the RSIA were shared with Chris Rooper, Linnea Flostrand and Sarah Hawkshaw.","In 2011, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) assessed Eulachon as three populations: the Central Pacific Coast (CPC) and Fraser River (FR) as Endangered, and the Nass/Skeena Rivers (NS) as Threatened.  A decision regarding SARA listing has not yet been decided.
Fraser and Central Coast DUs are listed as endangered under COSEWIC.   The shrimp trawl commercial fishery for the WCVI has an eulachon bycatch limit of 4 t.   Licence holders argue that the 4 t limit is restricting their fishery, and often request increases to the limit.

This advice did not provide suggested widths for riparian zones, indicating that widths would be species-specific, dependent on habitat requirements and regional differences (such as geomorphology, slopes etc.)

Atlantic Salmon Recovery Potential Assessments (RPA) (e.g., DFO 2014/021) have identified riparian buffer as a feature of important Atlantic Salmon freshwater habitat, yet they have not clearly defined this feature and noted at that time that it remained a research issue (Caissie 2006, Bowlby et al. 2013). The Species at Risk Program is looking to include riparian habitat in Atlantic salmon critical habitat. Once identified this critical habitat will be protected from destruction via a critical habitat Order. It will be important to have a clear understanding of the appropriate buffer width to help support its protection and inform discussions with relevant regulatory bodies (provincial departments) who manage land-based activities (e.g., forestry, agriculture, mining) on appropriate management protocols to minimize impacts and avoid destruction to the riparian buffer of Atlantic Salmon critical habitat.

Recently work has been completed by Integrated Planning on “The importance of riparian zone management for fish and fish habitat protection: analysis and recommendations for an Ecologically Significant Area Case Study of the St. Mary’s River, Nova Scotia”. This work could possibly contribute to this CSAS request. Additionally, the Province of New Brunswick is currently undergoing a review of existing legislation related to riparian zones, thus the information gained within this request could inform related DFO-NB discussions.

Information regarding activities that could destroy riparian zone buffers and the adequate width required is needed for all Maritimes region Atlantic salmon DUs, if listed. Work was underway to amend the iBoF recovery strategy to include new and updated information, but this was paused given the opportunity to develop a multi-DU recovery strategy should the other DUs be listed. Work on an iBoF specific recovery strategy will resume if the decision is not to list the other DUs.","If the species is listed, and a recovery strategy is prepared, DFO may be seen as neglecting to perform due diligence in considering the best available information to identify freshwater and estuarine critical habitat. The species may be negatively affected if freshwater, including riparian zone, and estuarine critical habitat is not protected.

If the Science advice is not provided there will be ongoing uncertainty with respect to appropriate management of buffer zones for the protection of Atlantic Salmon important (or critical) habitat.

In anticipation of the regional implementation of the WASCS in FY 2024-25, various information and data relevant to Maritimes Region Atlantic salmon designatable units (DUs) are required to support DFO decision-making activities, such as guidance around internal and external stock enhancement activities. 

In addition to the WASCS, decisions around the existing and expected SARA-listed Atlantic salmon populations require updated information. The Inner Bay of Fundy (iBoF) Designatable Unit (DU) has been listed under SARA as endangered since 2003. In addition, the outer Bay of Fundy (oBoF), Nova Scotia Southern Uplands (SU) and Eastern Cape Breton (ECB) DUs of Atlantic Salmon have also been assessed as endangered by the COSEWIC (2010) and are being considered for listing under the SARA. A listing decision is anticipated to occur in early 2023.

Information is dated (10+ years old) and updated data is required, such as juvenile abundance/presence-absence data and genetic baselines. 

The Precautionary Approach has been used to identify priority rivers, but it is unclear whether remnant Atlantic salmon populations still exist in these rivers. Up to date data and information to inform Atlantic salmon habitat protection under SARA is required. 

In addition, if listed under SARA, the need to develop performance indicators will be required to assess recovery at the level of the DU. Updated juvenile abundance information for at least the priority rivers identified would provide a baseline at the time of listing.

Updates and baseline information and data are required to support management decisions to ensure we decisions are made based on the most recent science.

1. Updated presence/absence for all rivers within a DU, but most importantly for priority rivers being selected for short-term recovery objectives and critical habitat designation, is required.

3. The ECB RPA (Gibson and Levy, 2014) indicates that genetic baselines are a criteria used to inform priority river identification. Genetic baselines are not known for the ECB population, thus SARP is requesting genetic baselines for all Maritimes Region Atlantic salmon DU's to inform both the priority river selection and refinement for ECB and to use as a potential performance indicator of recovery for each DU, if listed under SARA. Genetic baselines will also support decisions around stock enhancement and whether it is advisable or not advisable to being a supplementation program on a river-by-river basis. 

4. Identification of rivers throughout Maritimes region Atlantic salmon DU's in which it is advisable or not advisable to allow either DFO or external to DFO supplementation programs. 

5. Determine the rate of population change to identify whether a wild population is sustainable without supplementation to inform decisions regarding supplementation programs: 
	o Which rivers are projected to be sustainable as is without intervention?
	o Which rivers require some intervention to maintain a population?
	o Which rivers are extirpated?",SARP-Freshwater staff have been working in collaboration with Science - Salmon section to develop the questions and request.,"With the development and implementation of the WASCS, DFO needs to be proactive and ready to make decisions on Atlantic salmon management throughout the region with updated information. Given the current status of Maritimes region Atlantic salmon DU's, stock enhancement projects proposals are expected and we need to be prepared to respond to these requests. Identification of rivers that are advisable or not advisable for stocking as well as genetic baselines will help inform these decisions. 

Additionally, if the remaining three DU's are listed, we require baseline information (genetics and abundance) for short-term objective priority rivers as close to listing as possible to assess recovery of the population at the DU level. 

Identification of critical habitat is required for recovery strategies for species listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). The OBoF, SU and ECB Salmon are in the SARA listing process and, if listed, will require the development of one or more recovery strategies. The results of the priority river identification will be used to inform freshwater and estuarine critical habitat designation and included in the recovery strategies. These documents, including critical habitat designation, represent departmental and legal commitments to Atlantic Salmon recovery.

If the species is listed, the information will be used to identify critical habitat for the species/population under the Species at Risk Act, as well as provide advice and support to Fisheries Management, SARP, and Regulatory Reviews in making management and permitting decisions.","If we do not receive the science advise, DFO will default to using the Precautionary Approach instead and will be criticized for not using the most up to date information to inform Atlantic salmon management decisions.

Provide status of indicators - Provide the area where there is the main concentration of each species (adult and juvenile) and at which depth.

Indicators (where applicable/available/appropriate): - Landings - Abundance indices from the trawl survey (average number and weight per tow) - Abundance indices from the sentinel fisheries - Weight at age where applicable

4T Yellowtail flounder have been in the critical zone of the PA since 2009 and have been identified as a candidate species/stock to be listed under the amended Fisheries Act (C68 - Batch II).

To address the eminent listing of this stock, Gulf Region Resource Management is requesting science advice, not only to update the status and trend of the stock, but also to address the need to develop a rebuilding plan that is consistent with the requirements set out under the new Fish Stock Provisions. Although the scope of the present advice request goes beyond that of a regular stock assessment, there are commonalities between elements pertaining to a regular stock status/trend and those contained in an advice needed to develop a rebuilding plan. As such, Science may decide to partition this request in multiple assessments and review processes.

Introduction and Context - Briefly characterize the biology and environmental conditions affecting the stock. Communicate what is and is not known from an ecosystem perspective.
Description of Stock Status and Stock Trends - Provide estimated values of reference points and estimate current status relative to all available reference points (Limit Reference Point, Upper Stock Reference, Removal Reference and Target Reference Point) including the stock status and fishery status zone of the fish stock.

• Describe stock status trends, and if applicable, any additional indicators of importance to the stock assessment (e.g., fishing mortality, age structure, sex ratio, size distributions, etc.).

Probable Causes of the Stock’s Decline

Provide an overview of probable factors that have led to the decline of the species and/or those that may affect rebuilding (e.g., fishing mortality, non-fishing anthropogenic factors, biology of the stock, natural mortality, predator/prey interactions, environmental impacts including climate, oceanographic or ecosystem factors, habitat limitations).

Where possible, and relevant, identify the relative contribution of the probable causes to the decline, or those affecting or preventing rebuilding. Identify knowledge gaps.

Identify whether habitat loss or degradation is likely or unlikely to have contributed to the stock’s decline, given the current understanding of the best available evidence. If it is a probable cause, identify the type of habitat loss, its location(s), and how the stock uses the habitat.

Model the level of natural mortality and recruitment necessary to halt/reverse the declining.

Rebuilding Target and Timeline

• Provide advice on candidate rebuilding target, taking into account biology and the environmental conditions affecting the stock, and the desired probability of the stock being above the LRP (to be provided by fisheries management, when applicable) when the stock has achieved the rebuilding target.

• Calculate, the time to rebuild to the rebuilding target in the absence of all fishing (Tmin). If this is not possible, provide an estimate of an alternative such as generation time, to be used by Fisheries Management in setting a rebuilding timeline.

• Provide advice to assist with expressing the rebuilding objective in a measurable way (consisting of a rebuilding target, timeline, and where applicable, a desired probability of management measures achieving that target in the given timeline).

• Provide advice on other measurable stock conservation objectives where applicable and feasible including the desired state, probability and time period to achieve the objective, where possible.

Management Measures Aimed at Achieving the Objectives and Science Advice to Support Socio-Economic Analysis

• Advise on and evaluate the likelihood of potential management measures achieving the rebuilding objective, including habitat measures where applicable. Use decision or performance tables or graphics, if applicable.

• Identify whether stocks are more likely to decline than grow under conditions of no fishing and, where applicable, when other management measures (e.g., habitat restoration, hatchery enhancement, etc.) are also unlikely to result in stock growth. - Provide quantitative projections or simulations of the stock’s response to proposed management measures. Where not possible, provide information on expected consequences (quantitative and/or qualitative) of the benefits and risks
associated with the potential management measures.

Methods to Track Progress

• Advise on how to measure progress (setting performance metrics) against the objectives to achieve the target, particularly those related to the stock status.

Periodic Review of the Rebuilding Plan

• Advise on frequency of monitoring and assessment activities, including interim updates.

• Advise on exceptional circumstances under which it may be desirable to invoke a sooner-than-planned review of the rebuilding plan, such as: changes to the stock assessment model(s), large changes in stock status, new information that significantly changes understanding of stock status or population dynamics, significant ecological changes (e.g., predators or prey), major environmental events, etc.",Jenni McDermid,"The information will be used by Resources Management as part of the development of FSP-consistent rebuilding plan for 4T Yellowtail flounder, more specifically to inform, provide guidance and validate rebuilding objectives, management measures and methods to track progress towards rebuilding and through periodic review, to help determine if changes are needed in order to further protect the stock.","The main risk, if this science advice is not provided, would be failing to comply with the requirements set out under the new Fish Stock Provisions for stocks in the

Additionally, this advice would inform risks associated with I&T requests to areas of unsuitable habitat (i.e. areas with low risk of AIS establishment). Conceptually, not all AIS, if accidentally introduced through an I&T permit, would be able to establish. Therefore, it may be possible to permit I&T requests that are not like-to-like. Like-to-like transfers refers to requests with the AIS ecosystem composition at the donor and destination sites. Unfortunately, due to a number of environmental (e.g. climate change creating better environmental conditions for AIS establishment) and anthropogenic factors (e.g. recreational sailing or boating) the introduction and continual spread of non-indigenous species is rapidly increasing, which makes approval of I&T requests more challenging based solely on the like-to-like concept (which is the current framework used). The National Code on Introductions and Ransfers of Aquatic Organisms, Appendix 7, Part 1, Step 1 specifies that ecological risk assessment processes should include an estimate of the probability of a species to successfully establish if introduced and the ability of that species to spread further.

Once established, these species are able to continuously spread up the Canadian Atlantic Coasts through secondary spread vectors such as fishing vessels, recreational sailing and motor vessels, cruise ships, shipping vessels, etc. Fortunately, there exist biogeographic barriers (i.e. dramatic shifts in temperature and/or salinity) that act as a natural barrier to species dispersals (Lowen et al. in-prep). Theoretically, we could use these barriers to prevent or at least limit the spread of non-indigenous species.

The fishery is geographically widespread, with fishing practices and gear types that differ among rivers, and is managed primarily through effort controls. Within the Maritimes Region, the status of shad stocks has not been regularly assessed.

Towards the goal of developing an on-going monitoring and assessment program, a framework is required to provide an overview of the spatial scale for assessment and identification of stock units, reference points against which status could evaluated, monitoring methods, analytic methods and research recommendations, taking into account DFO’s precautionary framework for fisheries management.

Of note, a fundamental question is whether the Framework for the Assessment of the Status of River Herring Populations and Fisheries in DFO’s Maritimes Region (2016/105) can be applied to shad stocks and if so, to what extent.

This information will be used by Fisheries Management in order to refine fishing management decisions to best sustain the populations. For context, nn the late 1800’s shad were heavily exploited resulting in a marked decline in abundance. This resulted in the introduction of regulatory measures to protect the species. More recent controls such as the creation of fishing seasons, weekly closed times, fishing gear regulations and licensing policies have been implemented to better manage the fishery for long-term sustainability. The fishery is managed by effort controls and the information that will be gained from this advice will assist in determining the effectiveness of these measures and/or the need to introduce further effort controls.","Without the advice, fishery management measures will be guided as they currently are - highly dependent on year over year catch rates without consideration for the health of the stock or USR/LRP/ and exploitation rates.","2024-12-31 04:00:00","In discussion with Science program, given the lack of a current Research Scientist and ongoing gaspereau work within the same unit, the more realistic timeline for such a shad request in by December 31, 2024.

The advice could also be used to inform other risk-based decision making in other sectors of the Department. For example, this advice could be of interest to FFHPP when they conduct risk assessments for the establishment of Ecologically Significant Areas.","MPC NHQ is developing risk guidance to guide MPC practitioners in conducting ecological risk assessments to support Marine Protected Area (MPA) establishment. 

In the context of MPC NHQ's work to develop risk guidance, MPC practitioners have indicated that they would like additional national tools to help them identify potential interactions between activities, pressures, and conservation priorities (i.e., ecological components targeted for protection), in the Area of Interest (AOI, which is another word for the proposed MPA). Potential tools of this type would include a common set of PoEs, a master interaction matrix, or some other manner of showing interactions (or linkages) between activities/pressures and ecological components.

There are two potential ways in which Science Advice could support nationally consistent identification of the interactions between ecological components and activities/pressures:

1) Noting that CSAS Science Advice was recently provided to FFHPP to make their future PoE models more consistent across the sector (https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Schedule-Horraire/2021/02_23-26-eng.html), we would like to explore whether a similar advisory process could be held for MPC. More specifically, the advisory process would help us to distill down existing PoEs into a national library of core PoEs, and review and validate the contents of those core PoEs, as tools to support AOI risk assessments; 

or 

2) Noting that CSAS Science Advice was also recently provided to MPC to review the scores in Pacific and Atlantic vulnerability matrices and recommend revisions to individual scores (https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Schedule-Horraire/2021/11_29-30_12-02-eng.html), we would like to explore whether an advisory process could build off of that process, or from certain inputs used in that process, to support national tool development for AOI risk assessments. For example, inputs used into that advisory process could be used to create a nationally standard list of impacts of various pressures on various ecological components.

In any scenario, the Science Advice would have to be developed in a way that aligns with or can work with the AOI risk assessment methodology decisions already taken by MPC (as described in the 'Rationale or context for the request' section below). 

We recognize that more work is required to refine this request.","Pamela Allen, with whom discussion is still underway to refine this request.","An AOI risk assessment is conducted as part of the Oceans Act MPA establishment process, to ensure that the MPA regulation addresses risks posed by activities to the MPA's conservation objectives.

Since late 2020, the MPC Risk Working Group has met in a series of virtual meetings to develop and refine a nationally consistent, regionally flexible risk assessment methodology for establishing Oceans Act MPAs (using a Governor-in-Council (GiC) regulation) once an AOI has been chosen. 

With the support of the Marine Planning and Conservation oversight Committee (MPCC), the Working Group advanced the development of the risk assessment methodology based on the Options for Delivering Ecosystem-Based Marine Management (ODEMM) approach (https://odemm.com/). A ‘Phase 1’ Risk Guidance was presented to MPCC and approved in principle on September 27, 2022. The 'Phase 1' Risk Guidance also includes certain nationally standard lists, specifically a nationally standard list of activities, and a separate (unlinked) nationally standard list of pressures. Both of these lists are based on ICES lists, with minor modifications. 

MPC is now developing more comprehensive 'Phase 2' Risk Guidance that will include additional tools to support national consistency in AOI risk assessment, targeting February 2023 for completion. While this Science Advice would likely not occur in time to support the development of 'Phase 2' Risk Guidance, it would inform the development of longer-term tools to enhance national consistency in AOI risk assessments. By supporting more nationally consistent and streamlined risk assessments to support MPA establishment, the Science Advice would contribute towards achievement of Canada's marine conservation targets.","The consequence of not receiving this Science advice would be less consistent, and potentially more time consuming, AOI risk assessments, across regions.","2023-12-29 04:00:00","Our deadline to receive Science advice is the end of 2023, given that it may support risk assessments for the 2025 marine conservation target (in limited cases where risk work is not yet completed before end of 2023) and would support risk assessments for the 2030 target.

A Rebuilding Plan was drafted and is reviewed annually in a manner consistent with the Department's guidance document for the development of Rebuilding Plans.

The most recent full stock assessment (2019) for Bocaccio rockfish (BOR) noted strong evidence from the two most important trawl surveys and from the commercial fishery that a strong BOR cohort was spawned in 2016. The strong 2016 year class was projected to rebuild this stock above the limit reference point (LRP) (0.4BMSY) with a 0.95 probability by 2023 at catch levels up to 600 tonnes/year. An update to the 2019 stock assessment via Science Response was provided in 2021 to validate the size of the 2016 cohort and provide updated harvest advice to fishery managers. The Science Response projected the stock's growth above the upper stock reference point (USR) (0.8BMSY) with a 0.97 probability by 2023 even at catch levels up to 2,000 tonnes/year (the largest catch levels looked at). This updated stock assessment recommends that the assessment be again updated in 2023 when four new survey index values become available to continue the validation of the size of the 2016 cohort.  

The information from these surveys will support management of this growing 2016 year class.  A second Science Response to update the 2019 assessment is again needed in order to respond to changes in stock abundance in a timely manner and to determine if current harvest levels are sustainable and consistent with the Precautionary Approach and current Rebuilding Plan.

While this not an ecosystem (based) assessment it is critical to know the relative abundance of various ecosystem components before proceeding towards ecosystem based fisheries management.  This assessment will provide an updated time series of biomass estimates for the target species that can be used in the future to inform an ecosystem based approach.

This work contributes to the implementation of the policies within the Sustainable Fisheries Framework.","In the absence of updated science advice, there is increased uncertainty about the risks posed to the stock by current levels of catch, or the ability of the Department to manage the fishery in a way that will meeting rebuilding plan objectives.

They result in a net positive change in, or prevent the loss of, biodiversity in the MR. Direct BCBs are the focus of the conservation area (e.g., corals and cod in NL Region MRs), and indirect BCBs “other benefits” or “co-benefits” are expected to occur incidentally as a result of conservation measures implemented for direct BCBs in the area.

There has been a recent expansion/change of focus with respect to monitoring and reporting on MRs that moves beyond sole focus on their primary conservation objectives (COs) or direct biodiversity conservation benefits (BCBs) to also consider indirect biodiversity outcomes of these conservation areas.  

While each of the 5 MRs in NL Region have identified potential indirect BCBs, the process for identifying these several years ago was fairly ad hoc in nature, and largely based on knowledge of species in the area (EBSAs layers), paired with consideration of species of commercial significance. A more holistic, science-based determination of the most likely indirect BCBs within MRs is required to appropriately plan and undertake upcoming annual monitoring activities in MRs before including information from these activities in reporting to Canadians on regional marine conservation efforts.","Without science advice on what are the most likely indirect biodiversity conservation benefits of regional Marine Refuges, it is difficult to ensure ecological monitoring is targeting collection of appropriate variables inside MRs.

The MSE process uses operating models (OMs) to generate simulated data that represent alternative hypotheses for uncertain stock and fishery dynamics. Simulation-evaluation is then used to evaluate the performance of candidate fishery management procedures (MPs) against measurable stock and fishery objectives.

The Sablefish OM is a two-sex, age-structured model fit to multiple data sources, including: fishery-specific landed catch and at-sea releases from three gear types (trap, longline hook, and trawl), three indices of abundance, age composition data, and length-composition data.  Age composition data are key data types required to estimate (a) fishery and survey selectivity by sex and gear type when fitting the OM to data and (b) recruitment (needed for estimating stock productivity and consideration of environmental drivers). Uncertainty about the future capacity to age Sablefish otoliths given other competing priorities may impact the availability of age composition data moving forward. Inadequate age-composition data may compromise both the characterization of stock status and the ability of the management system to provide an acceptable trade-off of management outcomes. Therefore, an investigation is required into the sensitivity of the Sablefish MSE to the both the amount and allocation of age composition data between the sexes and among the survey and commercial gears.

Hydrodynamics of Saint-John River is significantly impacted by a series of hydropower dams and is likely to create watershed specific conditions which may be favorable for Zebra Mussel larvae to successfully migrate and access habitat downstream. In other words, would the hydrodynamics of the stream allow larvae to flow downstream and survive until they find adequate habitat to settle? And would the various dams, head ponds along the river (i.e.Edmundston, Beachwood, Grand Falls, Mactaquac) create suitable habitat to favor Zebra Mussel larvae settlement, establishment and recruitment?",NA,"Zebra Mussel has recently been found in Lac Témiscouata in Quebec.  Lac Témiscouata is at the headwaters of Rivière Madawaska which sheds into the Saint-John River Watershed.   It has been confirmed to be widespread in the lake and already established and reproducing.  Zebra Mussel is likely to migrate downstream with the currents during its veliger larval stage if stream hydrodynamics conditions are favorable. 

Existing literature suggests that “Zebra mussels have high dispersal potential via downstream transport of their microscopic veliger larvae in the water column”. It also suggests that “infested lakes can act as a source for riverine dispersal leading to establishment of new populations in their outflowing rivers and nearby downstream lakes (Horvath et al. 1996; Stoeckel et al. 1997; Bobeldyk et al. 2005). Studies on large river systems (Stoeckel et al. 1997; Stoeckel et al. 2004) suggest that riverine populations rely on the presence of upstream populations for recruitment but are able to disperse hundreds of river kilometers downstream if aided by the positioning of lakes, dams, and impoundments on such navigable waterways (Horvath et al. 1996; Allen and Ramcharan 2001;Smith et al. 2015). Such impoundments not only facilitate spread with increased boat traffic, but act as “stepping stones” for dispersal as reproducing populations may persist upstream of these dams and provide recruitment to further downstream  locations (Smith et al. 2015)”.

Zebra Mussel is one of the most significant aquatic invasive threat in Canada. Once established, these invasive mussels multiply quickly and can negatively impact aquatic ecosystems.  In Canada, Zebra Mussels cause millions of dollars in damage every year by clogging intake structures in power stations and water treatment plants as well as damaging watercrafts. Zebra Mussels are especially harmful for native mussels, many of which are species at risk.  Yellow lampmussel (YLM) is considered to be threatened and declining and is only known to exist in two location in Canada with one of them being in the Saint John River near Fredericton NB.  YLM are listed as a species of Special Concern under the Canadian Species at Risk Act.

The advice resulting from this CSAS will provide AIS-NCP (Gulf Region) and its partners with a better understanding of the risk of Zebra Mussel propagating and colonizing in the Saint-John River Watershed (from invaded Lac Témiscouata) via flow dispersal.   It will support planning and decision making to implement early detection, prevention, response and control management initiatives.  But ultimately this advice will allow a more targeted and predictable timelines for mitigating of the impacts of the Zebra Mussel on infrastructure and on natural environment if and/or once they have become established.

Note that, a good portion of the Saint John River Watershed and some other waterways in New Brunswick are within administrative boundaries for DFO Maritimes (i.e. Science, Fisheries Management, Species at Risk).","If this science advice is not provided, AIS-NCP Gulf would rely on existing literature to assess the risk of Zebra Mussel migrating and colonizing downstream from the infested/source lake, Lac Temiscouata.  Without this advice, the management approach according to the 4 pillars (early detection, prevention, response, Control and Managment) will not be as targeted (i.e. which parts of watershed will be impacted and when) and timelines for effective implementation will not be as clear and predictable.  It will not be as clear on how much efforts we should distribute between 1) mitigating the spread and impacts through flow dispersal and 2) mitigating the spread through transfers via biofouled watercrafts or gear.  This would likely result in wider and more significant impacts and additional costs for DFO, for tax payers and for the community at large.","2023-06-30 03:00:00","The spread of Zebra Mussel in The Saint-John River Watershed is potentially already occurring.

A tool to identify the net footprint would assist in determining a) whether an authorization is required, and b) the amount of offsetting required by the proponent.","If science advice is not provided, there will be disadvantages to both FFHPP and proponents submitting wharf and breakwater projects for review. It is important to note that the proponent for many wharf and breakwater projects, and consequently authorizations, is the Small Craft Harbours branch of DFO. Currently, FFHPP reviews project effects on habitat on an ad hoc, case by case basis. The anticipated science advice would provide consistent, scientifically defensible methodology to review such projects. This should improve the efficiency of reviews, as well as mitigation and offsetting decisions. Additionally, using the tool to incorporate positive habitat effects should reduce project footprints (and make them more accurate), likely reducing the number of projects that will require authorization. In the event that authorizations are required, the reduced project footprint should result in smaller, cheaper and more cost-effective offsetting plans.

It would allow all regions or national headquarters to develop effective mitigation measures or codes of practices to minimize impacts of underwater noise in freshwater habitats.,"The Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program recommends avoidance and mitigation measures to proponents and other permitting agencies to minimize the impacts of underwater noise to fish that utilize the freshwater environment. Some of these measures are based on migration periods of diadromous fish, while others are based on perceived impacts of pile driving. DFO is currently developing measures to mitigate impacts of underwater noise in the marine environment with a focus on marine mammals. There is little to no guidance on measures to minimize impacts to vertebrates in rivers (up to and including inner/upper estuaries – where freshwater begins to meet saltwater but river flow remains the dominant influence – not tides). This is particularly relevant for this region.

Questions for Science:
- Are the current mitigation measures for pile driving in freshwater rivers effective in minimizing impacts to vertebrates? More specifically:
Is avoiding pile driving during the migration periods of diadromous species effective?
Is a pile driving schedule of 4 hours on/4 hours off during a 24-hour period effective? Can the schedule be modified?
Are the Best Management Practices for Pile Driving and Related Operations used in British Columbia effective in freshwater rivers?
- What other mitigation measures could be implemented? For example:
Are there sound thresholds that could be implemented to minimize impact to vertebrates in freshwater rivers?

Initially serving as a mitigating management measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, an improved electronic monitoring program, similar to that of the groundfish hook and line fisheries which uses EM video and sensor data to audit the fisher-reported logbook, was designed and implemented in August 2021. Formal evaluation of the EM program is being sought to assess its suitability as an alternative to the ASOP in the Option A commercial groundfish trawl fishery.

This RSIA is staged in two connected steps:
Step 1. GMU requests a framework to evaluate the current trawl EM program as an alternative to observer-based at-sea monitoring. 

The framework should be designed to:
1. evaluate the accuracy and precision of EM-generated estimates of total catch by species by tow; and
2. compare EM-generated estimates relative to at-sea observer estimates (ie. retained, released and sensor data).
  
Step 2. Implement the framework via a study.

Draft updated protocols for the Option A trawl fishery are currently in development with service providers, industry, GMU & Science.

The approach to biological sampling for groundfish species was last reviewed approximately 15 years ago. Since that time, there have been substantial changes to the characteristics of groundfish fleets, the relative abundance of stocks including the emergence of ""choke point"" stocks, and the demands placed on Science for advice in support of management decisions.  The Covid-19 pandemic has changed at-sea monitoring for groundfish trawl fisheries by introducing at-sea Electronic Monitoring (EM) in lieu of the At-Sea Observer Program (ASOP).","Industry representatives from all of the Groundfish sectors have expressed concerns regarding the spatial and temporal coverage, and lack of biosamples, particularly with the removal of at-sea observers in early 2020 due to Covid-19, whose responsibility it was to collect biosamples on Option A trawl fishing trips. 

Biological samples from commercial groundfish fisheries are required for age-structured models, currently considered the gold standard in stock assessment.

Sectors: Marine Planning and Conservation, Ecosystem Management, Science. 

The ""Regional Assessment of Offshore Wind Development in Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia"" will be carried out by the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada to inform future development of offshore wind in Atlantic Canada. The draft study areas for the Regional Assessment include portions of DFO Maritimes Region, Gulf Region, and Newfoundland and Labrador Region. It is anticipated that future offshore wind development elsewhere in Canada could be informed by the science advice generated by this request

Information on the Pathway of Effects (PoE) and state of knowledge on environmental impacts from offshore wind development and activities will be relevant to multiple DFO branches with responsibilities related to this industry. This request will support the directive of the Marine Planning and Conservation Program to develop a Marine Spatial Plan, as the Plan will directly consider offshore wind development. The Ecosystem Management branch (Regulatory Review Program and Species at Risk Program) will be implicated as offshore wind development will necessitate regulatory decisions on behalf of DFO. Finally, science advice will be required in order to understand the potential impacts of offshore wind energy development on the marine environment, including threats to marine species listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) whose range and identified critical habitat overlap with areas being considered for offshore wind energy development.","Offshore wind energy is a new sector under development in Atlantic Canada, where strong wind speeds and suitable geophysical characteristics make this area appealing for large-scale development. The potential environmental impacts associated with the lifecycle of offshore wind energy development (e.g., construction, operations, decommissioning) have not been described yet for Canada. A review of fixed and floating offshore wind energy technologies that may be deployed in Canada is required to identify the works, undertakings, and activities (WUAs) associated with the offshore wind development lifecycle. This review will help determine gaps in knowledge and the need for additional PoE for offshore wind energy. The development of new PoE, if required, is also included in this request.

Advice requested includes: 

1. Evaluate WUAs associated with fixed and floating offshore wind energy development lifecycles and identify project components/receptors and pathways for stressor-effect linkages.
2. Describe the state of knowledge with respect to each stressor-effect linkage, including existing PoE for WUAs, and, where possible, a description of the effect and associated ecological impact (e.g., consideration of species, population, and/or ecosystem function level, as applicable and available), and the factors and conditions that influence the level of effect on fish and fish habitat, marine species-at-risk, and other issues of concern to DFO. 
3. Evaluate areas of uncertainty and gaps in knowledge related to stressor-effect linkages and within existing PoE.
4. Where possible, develop new PoE for fixed and floating offshore wind energy development to fill gaps in knowledge identified from step 3, or update existing applicable PoE.
5. Summarize and document the strength of evidence, challenges, limitations, and uncertainties that exist based on stressor-effect linkages in the above-mentioned PoE models (new and existing). Identify missing stressor-effect linkages.
6. Identify what mitigation measures could be implemented to minimize stressor-effect linkages of concern to DFO.
7. Identify the priority, outstanding knowledge gaps and science needs related to the understanding of stressor-effect linkages required to support scientific reviews of proposed offshore wind energy development.",Kyle Matheson,"The advice provided will be used directly by staff in Ecosystem Management to inform regulatory decisions made in relation to the SARA and Fisheries Act (FA). This information will support the Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program (FFHPP) in making future determinations with regard to the FA including (1) the prohibition against causing the death of fish, by means other than fishing (Section 34.4); and (2) the prohibition against causing the harmful alteration, disruption, or destruction of fish habitat (Section 35). The information will also be used to support determinations with regard to Sections 32, 33, and 58 of SARA. Species at Risk Program staff will also use this information during the recovery planning process for marine species listed under SARA. 

Science staff will use this advice to direct future monitoring and research needs and efforts to further assess and understand environmental effects of offshore wind energy development lifecycle activities.  

Finally, Marine Planning and Conservation will use this advice to inform Marine Spatial Plans and decision-support tools which enable decision making for offshore wind as an emerging sector. This advice will also inform multi-objective planning exercises which evaluate ecological, social, and economic trade-offs of development activities.","If science advice is not provided, DFO will not have current and up-to-date science information based on a Canadian marine context to complete regulatory reviews of offshore wind energy projects proposed in Canada, or to support recovery planning of species at risk in the marine environment that may be impacted. Instead, DFO will have to rely on information and research from other international jurisdictions that are unlikely to match Canada’s unique ecological characteristics and considerations. If DFO is unable to provide effective advice, this may also impact relationships with stakeholders and federal agencies. Furthermore, DFO’s understanding of research gaps and scientific uncertainties will be lacking, hindering the department’s ability to forecast and plan for science and research efforts needed to better understand the potential long-term impacts of offshore wind related activities and effective mitigation strategies.","2023-09-30 03:00:00","The Regional Assessment of Offshore Wind (RA) is expected to begin in January of 2023 and conclude in mid-2024, a timeline that has been set by the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada.

If science advice is not provided before Phase 1 of the RA concludes, this will limit DFO’s ability to meaningfully contribute to this process and provide effective advice. CSAS advice is also needed to ensure that DFO advice submitted to the RA is grounded in the best available science-based information.

Dr. Dounia Hamoutene from DFO Science was co-PI on the CSRF request.,"In accordance with the Canada-Provincial (NS/NB) MOUs on aquaculture development, DFO Maritimes Region reviews site proposals for land-based aquaculture facilities and provides advice to the provinces pursuant to our legislative mandate to protect fish and fish habitat, including species at risk. Multiple DFO sectors participate in the review which includes an assessment of risks to wild fish and fish habitat, including species at risk, from land-based aquaculture facility waste discharges. Multiple meetings (Science/FFHPP/AMP) have occurred during recent site reviews in the last couple of years. The most recent meeting identified the need for research to improve the understanding of potential impacts to fish and fish habitat from land-based facility effluent discharges in DFO Maritimes Region. 

Characterizing the effluent from modern land-based facilities (i.e., longer grow-out, waste removal systems, new feed formulations) of differing scales in the Maritimes Region and improving knowledge of the potential risks to fish and fish habitat with respect to chemical exposure, and nutrient and water quality alterations is critical to enable DFO to conduct comprehensive risk assessments and identify where additional mitigation measures are needed to reduce risks to fish and fish habitat. This will be reflected in DFO’s advice to the provinces.","Without the science advice, there is a risk that DFO is not meeting its legislative mandate to protect fish and fish habitat, including species at risk as optimally as possible. This would be due to potentially not incorporating the most scientific information on the physical/chemical characteristics of discharges from land-based facilities, therefore not identifying all risks to fish and fish habitat, not assessing them as accurately as possible, and not having risks mitigated. Without the science advice, there continues to be the potential for stymying development of the aquaculture sector through requiring design modifications to proposed land-based facilities or implementation of mitigation measures that are overburdensome, costly, and not grounded in up-to-date science.","2024-03-31 03:00:00","DFO Maritimes Region is expecting to continue receiving proposals for land-based aquaculture facilities from the provinces of NB and NS, and potentially at a greater rate as the Atlantic Salmon farming industry looks to expand its use of such facilities to address current production and environmental challenges.",0,"",1,"NB and NS provincial senior managers recently informed AMP that they consider this a priority.

SWAs are spill-treating agents (STAs) which enhance the removal of oil from shoreline surfaces to aid in recovery of spilled oil. What is the comparison of the key characteristics of SWA products? What products and technologies are available to be used as surface washing agents (in current practice, and new emerging technologies)? How does each product or technology work to remove stranded oil and what is the best use for each product or technology on different oil spill components and under what conditions that may be found in Canadian waters? What oil products are they used on and under what conditions are they most efficacious versus least efficacious? What are the potential toxicity impacts to Canadian species and ecosystems? Are there models or frameworks to guide decisions on the selection and use SWAs?  What are the logistical requirements for the operational use of SWAs? Are the newer formulations able to enhance the translocation of oil from shorelines as effectively as SWAs currently in use, with fewer environmental concerns? What are the outstanding science needs to support the use of surface washing agents during a response in Canada?","Travers Pretorius, Cory Dubetz, Ken Lee, Terry Johnston","Following an oil spill, there is a need to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of all available response tools. Shorelines frequently suffer adverse impacts from oil spill accidents. As one important technique of shoreline cleanup, the application of surface washing agents (SWAs) can help achieve high oil removal from shoreline substrates with less damage to affected zone. 
This process will help to inform the operational response regime on considerations for the use of SWAs at a national level (including DFO, CCG, ECCC and external organizations). The information will also be directly used to support the Alternative Response Measures (ARMs) Initiative should proposed legislative changes allowing for the use of different response measures be approved in the near future. DFO Environmental Incident Coordinators will utilize the advice from this process to support decision-making in Incident Command during a response to an oil spill.","Without proper scientific advice on the best practices for the use, application, monitoring and impacts of surface washing agents, the department cannot as efficiently and effectively help inform critical and time sensitive decisions about the use of specific response measures. The lack of timely advice as part of that decision-making process could result in greater impacts to the aquatic ecosystem. The Government of Canada needs to be able to explain to the public how the best available scientific information is integrated into spill response decisions, as well as communicate the pros, cons, considerations and limitation associated with specific methods, which would be better informed with an updated and comprehensive review process.","2025-03-31 03:00:00",The advice will be used to inform the development of policy and guidance (which has specific legal and regulatory requirements) once proposed legislative changes to allow for the use of Alternative Response Measures in Canada have been approved in Parliament.

Regulatory Review in FFHPP may incorporate existing data collated from this request during assessments of proposed development projects that may impact fish and fish habitats (Fisheries Act reviews, Impact Assessment, and Environmental Impact Assessment).  Outcomes from this process will also align with freshwater habitat programs within DFO Science, including with science priorities developed within the Freshwater Habitat Science Initiative (FHIN).","1)	Given the available data on freshwater and estuarine fish and fish habitats, identify areas that are unique or rare, sensitive, and or highly productive, or otherwise ecologically important in Newfoundland and Labrador.

3)	Compile a list of existing datasets, DFO publications, and non-published literature  that may contain information or data relevant to answering questions 1 and 2, which will also be used by FFHPP to identify the historic and current state of fish and fish habitats within freshwater systems as it pertains to Atlantic Salmon and American Eel.  

The definitions of sensitive, highly productive, rare/unique for this request can be provided as they comprise the national 'Ecologically Significant Area' ecological criteria. 
This request will require coordination of expert knowledge and application of quantitative freshwater datasets (within the department holdings) and will require science-based advice on fish community information, including species distribution, abundance, population trends, community composition, habitat classification and assessment","Tom Bird (relocated to Pacific Region) and Victoria Neville of Ecological Sciences provided advice and assisted in the development of this request. Victoria has discussed this request with Keith Clark, Amanda Park, Curtis Pennell, and Nadine Wells. Camille Macnaughton (Science Advisor in NCR for Freshwater Habitat Science Initiative (FHIN)) from Environment and Biodiversity Science) has also reviewed and provided advice for this request.","The Minister’s Mandate letter specifies that our Department must support the Minister to implement the modernized Fisheries Act, which resulted in new National priorities for FFHPP including Ecologically Significant Areas, Fish Habitat Restoration Priorities, State of Fish and Fish Habitat reports, and identification and addressing cumulative effects. This CSAS request outlines areas where Science advice is critically needed to support the policies and programs of the FFHPP, some of which have been highlighted in the 2022-23 Departmental Plan.  The request aligns with science priority themes developed in coordination with FFHPP for the Freshwater Habitat Science Initiative (FHIN). This initiative is part of a renewal of Freshwater Habitat Science at DFO and provides key support and science advice on freshwater issues to the FFHPP for both regulatory decision-making and the development of tools associated with an amended Fisheries Act.

The deliverables will be directly used to advance several national and regional priorities of the FFHPP -  Integrated Planning & Partnership program.  Specifically, the requested information will advance efforts to identify areas that may benefit from the establishment of Ecological Significant Areas (ESAs). The results of this CSAS process would identify areas that provide important fish habitats that otherwise are unlikely to be protected, as the ESA program provides opportunities to protect aquatic habitats where other existing protection tools are not suitable.

Restoration of Fish and Fish Habitat has been identified as one of four key priorities in the 2022-23 Departmental Plan. A number of departmental initiatives are currently underway to identify and strategically plan restoration activities, and this work will support the development of a Regional Restoration Strategy, a companion to the National Framework to Identify Fish Habitat Restoration Priorities. The establishment of priorities for fish habitat restoration will be used to enhance the coordination of regional restoration planning and improve decision-making for aquatic resources.

FFHPP nationally is required to develop an annual State of Fish and Fish Habitat Report to help identify restoration needs and threats to fish habitats, as well as track efforts by the department to improve the state of the habitat. The requested information will assist in the development of this report and help authors focus on areas of particular importance. 

To assist in the advancement of restoration priorities, the Government of Canada has established a number of Grant and Contribution (G&Cs) programs, administered through FFHPP. The requested CSAS information will aid in prioritizing proposed G&C restoration projects, in response to the regional restoration strategy and the State of Fish and Fish Habitat report, mentioned above.

Additionally, the information from this CSAS will be integrated into a geospatial tool to support other FFHPP initiatives (and DFO sectors) including the identification restoration priority areas and projects for funding, cumulative effects and a resource to inform sound decision-making with respect to regulatory assessments (Fisheries Act Reviews, Impact Assessment, and Environmental Impact Assessment) of proposed development projects.","It will be challenging for the FFHPP to meet its National priorities that have been outlined in the Speech from the Throne, highlighted in the Minister's Mandate Letter, and included in the Departmental Plan. Advances to meet national priorities will not be scientifically sound or defensible without Science advice

Available freshwater data within the FFHPP is severely lacking and identifying data available within the Department to assist the FFHPP with developing a comprehensive baseline understanding of ecologically and biologically important freshwater habitats, vulnerable areas, and areas where habitats can be restored to reverse past damage forms the foundation of meeting the programs national priorities and Departmental objectives. The information and data requested through CSAS will provide the foundation for the advancement of numerous IPP priorities.

Over the last two years, attempts by FFHPP to identify external sources of freshwater data have been ongoing through various avenues including the creation of the Freshwater Data Sharing Working Group. To date no external stakeholders have been able/willing to share their data, further amplifying the need for CSAS support.

A dedicated effort through DFO Science/CSAS is required to identify, locate and collate existing freshwater species and habitat data in order to advance priority FFHPP files. The outcome of this process will surely benefit science, through collaboration with FFHPP.","2024-03-31 03:00:00","The priorities for the FFHPP Program have been repeatedly highlighted in Minister's Letter and Departmental Plans. As we progress into year 5 of the Integrated Planning program, it is crucial that we make timely progress on these priorities. The first regional State of Fish and Fish Habitat Report is expected to be finalized this fiscal year; National Frameworks for ESAs, Fish Habitat Restoration Priorities, and cumulative effects are anticipated to be finalized in the coming month and expected to be operational in the coming fiscal year. The information and data requested through CSAS will provide the foundation for the advancement of numerous IPP priorities. 

In particular, the identification of freshwater and estuarine fish and fish habitat in the Newfoundland and Labrador region which are sensitive, highly productive and rare/unique is one of the first steps and key foundational building blocks for the ESA program, and all subsequent steps to successfully developing ESA regulations, hinge on having identified important freshwater/estuarine species and characteristics that may warrant protection. This program requires scientifically supported sites to pursue in the next fiscal year. 

National timelines dictate that information (i.e. existing databases and literature list) to support the development of the Regional Restoration Strategy are to be compiled by May 2023, corresponding with national deadline for internal DFO feedback before Wave 3 external engagement. The Regional Restoration Strategy first draft is due to the Integrated Planning National Subcommittee (IPNS) and the Biodiversity and Ecosystems Management Oversight Committee (BEMOC) by May 2024, so comprehensive information would be required by December 2023.
The timeline to incorporate science advice into the 2023 State of Fish and Fish Habitat report is already passed, but Science advice collated through this request can be used for future reports. 

The requested science information will assist in identifying the historic state of fish and fish habitat and be utilized to identify trends in habitat degradation, pinpoint threats historic threats, categorize cumulative effects, and advance restoration priorities.",1,It is anticipated that funds may be available to support extra costs associated with this request.

Victoria has discussed this request with Keith Clark, Amanda Park, Curtis Pennell, and Nadine Wells. Camille Macnaughton (Science Advisor in NCR for Freshwater Habitat Science Initiative (FHIN)) from Environment and Biodiversity Science) has also reviewed and provided advice for this request.","The Minister’s Mandate letter specifies that our Department must support the Minister to implement the modernized Fisheries Act, which resulted in new National priorities for FFHPP including Ecologically Significant Areas, Fish Habitat Restoration Priorities, State of Fish and Fish Habitat reports, and identification and addressing cumulative effects. This CSAS request outlines areas where Science advice is critically needed to support the policies and programs of the FFHPP, some of which have been highlighted in the 2022-23 Departmental Plan.  The request aligns with science priority themes developed in coordination with FFHPP for the Freshwater Habitat Science Initiative (FHIN). This initiative is part of a renewal of Freshwater Habitat Science at DFO and provides key support and science advice on freshwater issues to the FFHPP for both regulatory decision-making and the development of tools associated with an amended Fisheries Act.

The deliverables will be directly used to advance several national and regional priorities of the FFHPP -  Integrated Planning & Partnership program.  Specifically, the requested information will advance efforts to identify areas that may benefit from the establishment of Ecological Significant Areas (ESAs). The results of this CSAS process would identify areas that provide important fish habitats that otherwise are unlikely to be protected, as the ESA program provides opportunities to protect aquatic habitats where other existing protection tools are not suitable.

Restoration of Fish and Fish Habitat has been identified as one of four key priorities in the 2022-23 Departmental Plan. A number of departmental initiatives are currently underway to identify and strategically plan restoration activities, and this work will support the development of a Regional Restoration Strategy, a companion to the National Framework to Identify Fish Habitat Restoration Priorities. The establishment of priorities for fish habitat restoration will be used to enhance the coordination of regional restoration planning and improve decision-making for aquatic resources.

FFHPP nationally is required to develop an annual State of Fish and Fish Habitat Report to help identify restoration needs and threats to fish habitats, as well as track efforts by the department to improve the state of the habitat. The requested information will assist in the development of this report and help authors focus on areas of particular importance. 

To assist in the advancement of restoration priorities, the Government of Canada has established a number of Grant and Contribution (G&Cs) programs, administered through FFHPP. The requested CSAS information will aid in prioritizing proposed G&C restoration projects, in response to the regional restoration strategy and the State of Fish and Fish Habitat report, mentioned above.

Additionally, the information from this CSAS will be integrated into a geospatial tool to support other FFHPP initiatives (and DFO sectors) including the identification restoration priority areas and projects for funding, cumulative effects and a resource to inform sound decision-making with respect to regulatory assessments (Fisheries Act Reviews, Impact Assessment, and Environmental Impact Assessment) of proposed development projects.","It will be challenging for the FFHPP to meet its National priorities that have been outlined in the Speech from the Throne, highlighted in the Minister's Mandate Letter, and included in the Departmental Plan.

The information and data requested through CSAS will provide the foundation for the advancement of numerous IPP priorities.

Over the last two years, attempts by FFHPP to identify external sources of freshwater data have been ongoing through various avenues including the creation of the Freshwater Data Sharing Working Group. To date no external stakeholders have been able/willing to share their data, further amplifying the need for CSAS support.

A dedicated effort through DFO Science/CSAS is required to identify, locate and collate existing freshwater species and habitat data in order to advance priority FFHPP files. The outcome of this process will surely benefit science, through collaboration with FFHPP.","2024-01-31 04:00:00","Ideally, Science advice and information would be available by Jan 2024 but will also be useful beyond this date. The priorities for the FFHPP Program have been repeatedly highlighted in Minister's Letter and Departmental Plans.

The first regional State of Fish and Fish Habitat Report is expected to be finalized this fiscal year; National Frameworks for ESAs, Fish Habitat Restoration Priorities, and cumulative effects are anticipated to be finalized in the coming month and expected to be operational in the coming fiscal year. The information and data requested through CSAS will provide the foundation for the advancement of numerous IPP priorities. 

In particular, the identification of freshwater and estuarine fish and fish habitat in the Newfoundland and Labrador region which are sensitive, highly productive and rare/unique is one of the first steps and key foundational building blocks for the ESA program, and all subsequent steps to successfully developing ESA regulations, hinge on having identified important freshwater/estuarine species and characteristics that may warrant protection. This program requires scientifically supported sites to pursue in the next fiscal year. 

National timelines dictate that information (i.e. existing databases and literature list) to support the development of the Regional Restoration Strategy are to be compiled by May 2023, corresponding with national deadline for internal DFO feedback before Wave 3 external engagement. The Regional Restoration Strategy first draft is due to the Integrated Planning National Subcommittee (IPNS) and the Biodiversity and Ecosystems Management Oversight Committee (BEMOC) by May 2024, so comprehensive information would be required by December 2023.

These questions posed to Science are vital to understand how to set up management programs for success over time, and how to understand when success is achieved. These questions have been posed to DFO by several outside partners including industry, community groups, not-for-profit societies and Indigenous groups.

How is the risk level influenced by factors such as space, time, fishery, and environment? 

Background:
This CSAS request focuses on the risk of entanglement posed by fixed fishing gear to the endangered North Atlantic right whale (NARW) in Eastern Canada. Fisheries interactions is one of two primary threats to NARW, whose current population estimate is 340 individuals.
DFO Resource Management requests that DFO Science characterize the risk of entanglement posed by fixed gear fishing activities in Eastern Canada to NARW, focusing on priority areas such as the Gulf of St. Lawrence and NARW Critical Habitat, but also quantifying risk where data is available for areas where NARW are less commonly observed, such as the Scotian Shelf which they traverse en route to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and waters off Newfoundland. This analysis should include within scope all fixed gear fishing activities, including commercial and Indigenous (commercial and FSC). This analysis will likely require several components, including 1) data on NARW distribution in Canada, 2) data on fishing activity distribution and gear configurations in Canada and 3) an analysis of fishing gear entanglement risk to whales, considering co-occurrence and the potential impact of various gear types to the whale.
Canada has implemented comprehensive fisheries management measures to reduce the risk of entanglement to NARW since 2018, including dynamic and adaptive fishing closure protocols, lost gear reporting, ghost gear retrieval, gear marking regimes and a systematic surveillance program. Looking to the future, Canada has committed to implementing lower breaking strength gear modification requirements in all non-tended fixed gear, trap and pot fisheries in Atlantic Canada and Quebec, including lobster and snow crab trap fisheries. DFO is also considering how to further reduce entanglement risk by reducing vertical lines through gear configurations (e.g. trawling up) and by supporting more widespread use of ropeless or rope on demand fishing systems. DFO reviews and adjusts NARW management measures regularly, using the best available information including Science input and harvester feedback, to support the protection and recovery of NARW.
This CSAS request is viewed by RM as an initial step to support a future request for Science advice to quantify the risk reduction value of relevant management measures in fisheries that pose an entanglement risk to NARW. This information will allow the Department to assess the effectiveness of existing management measures and inform future management decisions. The Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF) has undertaken a preliminary analysis of the effectiveness of these measures at reducing entanglement risk to NARW in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence snow crab. CWF found that the closure protocol alone reduced risk by 65%, and the full suite of implemented measures reduced risk by 82%.","Adèle Labbé

Stephanie Ratelle","The advice would be used by Resource Management in NHQ to support evidence-based fisheries management decisions to reduce the risk of entanglement to NARW. This information would also be used by RM in QC, GF, MAR and NL regions who implement these management measures in their fisheries.  This evaluation will form the basis from which future Science advice will be sought on the effectiveness of various management measures. This information may also be used by SARP and Science in their own work to support the protection and recovery of NARW.
Effective threat reduction/prevention measures to protect and recover the North Atlantic right whale are required under Canada’s Species at Risk Act, and these measures may also influence ecocertifications and comparability findings required to meet the import provisions of the US Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and maintain Canada’s access to the multi-billion dollar U.S. seafood export market. Canadian seafood products imported to the US must be harvested in fisheries with measures in place to reduce harm to marine mammals that are comparable in effectiveness to equivalent US fisheries. NOAA is currently working through Phase 2 of the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, to reduce serious entanglement risk of NARW by 90% in relevant fisheries, using a modeling approach to explore the risk reduction outcomes of various gear modification and management scenarios.","Fishery management decisions will be made without robust scientific analysis of entanglement risk to NARW. This may result in measures being imposed that are not as effective at reducing the risk of serious entanglement to NARW or may cause secondary environmental impacts (e.g. weak links contributing to ghost gear), while imposing economic or other costs to stakeholders and partners.
Canada may be criticized for being unable to quantify the effectiveness of fisheries management measures intended to reduce entanglement risk to NARW, which the Department is obligated to protect and recover under Canada’s Species at Risk Act. 
This science advice is also required in order to inform future analysis of the effectiveness of current and potential management measures to reduce the risk of entanglement to NARW.

This framework would provide the necessary criteria against which progress, and success of management strategies can be measured and assessed against species recovery and habitat conservation objectives. The scale of such framework is expected to be relevant to management e.g., specific ecosystems which are defined by water properties and species composition and high vessel traffic areas.","What should be the units, criteria and target values (e.g., % tolerable impacted area, duration per day, or days per year, etc.), and noise unit and values for anthropogenic continuous underwater sound (e.g., 90% exceedance of 120dB SEL, spikes in noise over 160dB rms, etc.) that should not be exceeded to avoid biologically significant adverse effects considering regional and subregional specificities and indicator species.","Andrew J Wright, Res Scientist, Maritimes","A number of species at risk action plans, specifically including marine mammal species, are listing recovery measures to be undertaken collaboratively between Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Transport Canada to address the adverse impacts of vessel traffic, e.g., ship strike, disturbance and impacts of continuous underwater radiated noise. These plans list a number of actions to explore, develop, and apply noise mitigation measures to minimize physical and acoustic impacts on whales and their habitat, including speed reduction, moving shipping lanes/vessel traffic route, no-go areas, delimit spatial and temporal zones and other operational procedures, practices and maintenance in addition to modifications or technical innovations for the various fleets. 

Under the Whales Initiative, the Government committed to exploring the concept of Underwater Vessel Noise Management Plans (UVNMPs) which are intended to be custom plans combining operational and technological measures to reduce the impact of vessel underwater noise on marine mammals and the marine environment over time. This concept of UVNMPs is also embedded in the revised International Maritime Organisation 2014 Guidelines for the reduction of underwater noise from commercial shipping to address adverse impacts on marine life. For the past year, Canada has been coordinating the work of the IMO on this agenda item and is expected to continue to play this leadership role and actively participate in the discussions and intersessional work along with European member states, which intend to reflect the outcomes of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. 

A series of engagement sessions were held by Transport Canada to obtain stakeholder feedback on the concept and nature of UVNMPs. The need to first identify underwater noise reduction targets was highlighted through these consultations. Proposed vessel-source reduction targets were developed and are currently the subject of policy discussions (National Underwater Vessel Noise Reduction Target Advisory Committee led by Transport Canada). The proposed reduction targets were established by vessel type (Container Ship, Bulker, Tanker, Tug, Vehicle Carrier/General Cargo Vessel, Cruise Ship and Fishing Vessel) and would require reducing the source levels of all vessels within a type to the median radiated noise level.

These targets are not biologically driven or defined in terms of the spatial distribution, temporal extent and noise levels which address the adverse effects of exposing populations of marine animals to underwater noise pollution. The proposed reduction targets are based on the precautionary principle that all source level reductions are beneficial because of their potential positive effects on quieting the overall soundscape. However, to evaluate if these proposed vessel-source reduction targets are sufficient for achieving conservation objectives and evaluate and prioritize management strategies including area-based and seasonal management measures to offer the greatest effect in terms of risk reduction and trade-offs, an assessment method and framework is required.

Such framework would be of use to environmental policies and sciences government officials involved in developing and assessing vessel management strategies within the context of marine spatial planning and environmental assessment of marine projects within Canada. 

Currently, there is little guidance and few prescriptive approaches for the wide-scale management of underwater noise impacts on marine mammals. The aspirational intent of this CSAS project would be to develop a framework align with the European MSFD “good environmental status” with regards to anthropogenic underwater continuous sound.",not filled in by requestor,"2024-12-31 04:00:00",Not filled in by requestor.,1,"Funds available, amount TBD",1,"High – given the government commitment of developing UVNMPs, its leadership role at the IMO and proposed timeline for completing the work, Canada’s Oceans Noise Strategy, and the imminent outcomes of the MSFD work on setting thresholds values for continuous noise expected to be finalised by the end of this year 2022, this CSAS proposal would be timely in supporting vessel management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of underwater radiated noise and help support and address research gaps identified by Canada’s Oceans Noise Strategy.",20,"2022-11-10 21:44:48.085381",,2285,2285,107,2285,,,2025,2023,4

•	Information on seasonal distribution and abundance in Canadian waters based on verified detections of these three species; 
•	Information on potential risks from fixed gear fisheries, by assessing these species’ cooccurrence with fixed gear fisheries.

Background:
This CSAS request focuses on other at-risk whale species that are found in similar areas as the North Atlantic right whale, face similar threats (e.g. entanglement), and who have been assessed by COSEWIC as endangered and/or listed as endangered under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). These species include the Northwest Atlantic Blue whale, Atlantic Fin whale and Atlantic Sei whale. While Canada has implemented comprehensive fisheries management measures to reduce the risk of entanglement to NARW since 2018, these at-risk whales populations have not been subject to similar attention or focus of management efforts despite their at-risk status and facing similar threats. However, the Marine Mammal Response Program team in DFO annually receives and responds to reports of entanglements of other at-risk whale populations. 
Given Canada’s obligations to listed endangered whales under SARA to address threats and support their protection and recovery, ongoing requirements under the US Marine Mammal Protection Act to demonstrate measures to protect marine mammals in Canadian fisheries are comparable to US fisheries, and the funding that is being sought through the Whales Initiative 2.0 Renewal to generate science information other endangered whale populations, DFO requests an analysis of
I.	Seasonal distribution and abundance of the Northwest Atlantic Blue Whale and the Atlantic Fin and Sei Whale in Canadian waters based on verified detections from all sources; 
II.	Potential risks to these at-risk whales from fixed gear fisheries in areas of co-occurrence.
Funding has been requested through the Whales Initiative 2.0 Renewal to specifically expand surveillance and efforts that are currently for NARW, to other endangered whale populations who share habitat and threats.

Threats have been identified for the Northwest Atlantic Blue Whale, Atlantic Fin and Sei Whale, including entanglement. As such, further investigation is needed as DFO is the department responsible for the sustainable management of aquatic species, including the obligation to protect and recover endangered species listed under the Canada’s Species at Risk Act. Information sought now, will place the Department in the best position to properly respond to any future crises.

However, alternative shoreline protection treatments may provide better fish habitat (i.e., greater fish productivity) despite having a larger in-water footprint. The objective of this request is to evaluate fish utilization of shoreline stabilization structures to inform DFO-FFHPP's review of preferred design features on Lake Ontario’s shoreline. Specifically, which shoreline protection design supports greater fish productivity along nearshore habitats of the western basin of Lake Ontario?

This question may be answered by reviewing and analyzing existing year-round nearshore fish community data from government agencies and Conservation Authorities within the western basin of Lake Ontario (Niagara River to Rouge River). Fish productivity metrics may potentially include species richness, abundance, Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), or Habitat Productivity Index (HPI) along various shoreline protection treatments (e.g., groynes, revetments, beach headlands, dynamic cobble beaches, vertical sea walls, breakwaters). Potential implications for Species-at-Risk (SAR) may also be considered, such as Pugnose Shiner, American Eel or other SAR occupying nearshore habitats in Lake Ontario.",This project has been discussed with Dr. Jon Midwood.  This project may be informed by the systematic review completed for shoreline protection.,"The request would provide guidance for DFO-FFHPP's review of shoreline protection projects along Lake Ontario.

The results of this CSAS request will support DFO-FFHPP Biologists by providing consistent, science-based guidance to proponents when recommending various shoreline stabilization designs to minimize the impacts on the surrounding fish communities. The findings may be widely applicable to the Great Lakes and other large waterbodies requiring shoreline protection.","The most common type of shoreline protection design in Lake Ontario is an armourstone revetment, which provides little in terms of fish habitat diversity. If no additional science advice is provided, DFO-FFHPP Biologists will not have the knowledge or support to recommend alternate fish-friendly shoreline stabilization designs. This may result in the continuous uniform hardening of Lake Ontario's shoreline, providing minimal habitat diversity for fish utilizing the nearshore and open-coast environment.","2023-12-31 04:00:00","Given that approximately 75% of western Lake Ontario's shoreline has been hardened, it is crucial to understand how artificially hardened shorelines are influencing fish productivity and how these impacts can be avoided or mitigated through alternate designs.

This information would be incorporated into an Integrated Fisheries Management Plan. Species at Risk has recently submitted a Recovery Strategy for executive approval, prior to community consultations. The stock delineation issue will come up at the community meetings and will likely delay approval if information cannot be provided.","The hunters in Pangnirtung state that the beluga in Cumberland Sound have morphological (yellow and white, and size) and behavioral (some move into Clearwater Fiord early, some behave 'dumb') differences. They can tell the beluga apart by these differences and have identified at least two populations of beluga. 

In 2022, a Science Advisory Report was developed titled Genetic Assessment for discrimination of beluga in Cumberland Sound. Two distinct stocks were identified using genetics. 

Do the genetics results align with the behavioural and morphological traits reported by hunters? Are there any ways to tell the two genetic stocks apart? (a separate CSAS request has been made regarding Cumberland Sound Beluga movement)","Cortney Watt, Science, Ontario & Prairie Region","The issue of multiple stocks has been raised by the community for decades and needs to be answered to be able to move forward with effective management of the species. The results of the 2022 genetics work showed that there are two genetically distinct populations of beluga in Cumberland Sound from the Cumberland Sound Beluga population and the Western Hudson Bay beluga population. While the information has yet to be presented to the community due to the timing of these submissions, Fisheries Management anticipates that hunters in Pangnirtung and the Working Group will question if the genetics results aligns with the traditional knowledge of two stocks based on morphological and behavioural differences. 

The hunters in Pangnirtung have been saying for decades that there are two stocks of beluga in Cumberland Sound based on their observations. They have observed that the first beluga migrating through Cumberland Sound to Clearwater Fiord are white and 'smart'. A later wave of beluga are yellow and 'dumb'. Usually the quota is reached quickly when the first group of beluga are moving through and therefore it is assumed that the hunt samples provided are from the white/smart beluga but without enhanced reporting and additional information on timing, location and appearance, we don't have a way to tell samples apart. Working with the Hunters and Trappers Organization will be an important part of this work to ensure samples are collected that represent both the behavioural/morphically distinct populations. 

It is important to know if the genetics aligns with the behaviour and/or morphological differences seen by the hunters to help inform management decisions. If there is a way to tell the populations apart then there may be a way to target specifically populations. 

This question is being asked by Fisheries Management on behalf of the Cumberland Sound Beluga Working Group which includes DFO, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB), the Qikiqtaaluk Wildlife Board, Pangnirtung Hunters and Trappers Organizations (HTO), and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI).  The Nunavut  Agreement identifies the maintenance of vital, healthy, wildlife populations capable of sustaining harvesting needs as a principle of conservation (S. 5.1.5 (c)), and recognizes that Government (DFO) retains ultimate responsibility for wildlife (fisheries) management (S. 5.2.33). DFO Science advice will be incorporated into decision making for the management of beluga in Cumberland Sound and submitted for NWMB decision.","Incomplete or outdated advice used in management decisions could negatively affect the species and the ecosystem.  DFO needs to know if we can manage the populations in Cumberland Sound by hunters visual assessments. Without this advice, DFO is managing the beluga in Cumberland Sound as one stock. If there is a way to tell the two genetic populations apart that would provide opportunities for management decisions. 

If updated Science advice is not provided on the stock structure of Cumberland Sound Beluga progress in developing an Integrated Fisheries Management Plan or developing management strategies to protect the Cumberland Sound population, including quota adjustments will be further delayed. This will likely lead to continued decline in the already Threatened population. There are already adverse impacts on stakeholders as the community is frustrated and struggles to be heard regarding this issue that is raised at every meeting. The community of Pangnirtung has indicated to DFO that they want more research on these topics and would most likely not be accepting of quota reductions unless these areas of research are addressed.","2023-10-15 03:00:00","The information is needed as soon as possible.

Incorporating Indigenous knowledge and indicators into the assessment may be important to the community but needs to be confirmed.",Joclyn Paulic,"Generation Mining is proposing an open pit mine near the town of Marathon, ON, and within the asserted exclusive Aboriginal Title Area of Biigtigong Nishnaabeg (BN). The proposed mine is currently undergoing an Environmental Assessment under CEAA 2012, and a final decision is expected by the end of November 2022. In their August 2022 report, the Joint Review Panel (JRP) concluded that the project would have significant adverse environmental effects for each of the s. 5(1)(c) elements of CEAA 2012 as it relates to BN, which is a precedent-setting conclusion.

In its list of recommendations, the JRP recommended that the federal and provincial governments assist in developing a BN-run fish hatchery, which would be used to stock fish in BN’s asserted exclusive Aboriginal Title Area. DFO has since learned that the goal of this fish hatchery and stocking program is to address BN’s concerns regarding a decrease in the number of fish they are able to catch in their exclusive Aboriginal Title Area. DFO and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) have met with BN and noted that the root cause of the decline in fish numbers must first be identified before a hatchery can be considered.

This could be considered an accommodation measure to support understanding cumulative effects and the Project’s adverse impacts to BN’s rights associated with the aquatic environment. This would further BN’s understanding of the status of fish and fish habitat in their Title Area, and support the Department’s commitment to reconciliation. 

Close collaboration with Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) will be important given their role as fisheries managers.

Additional scoping will be necessary once a federal decision is made on the project, which would include extensive discussions with BN and MNRF.","The provincial government is not likely to be supportive of a fish hatchery and stocking program without knowing the cause of, and potential solutions for, the perceived decreased number of fish in BN’s asserted exclusive Aboriginal Title Area. It is likely that it is the result of multiple stressors including those on fish habitat. Given that the issue of decreased and/or changes in fish catch is expected to be exacerbated as a direct result of the Marathon Palladium Project, not providing this advice would limit DFO’s ability to address BN’s concerns and provide advice to other agencies and the proponent on priorities to support fish and fish habitat in the area.","2025-03-31 03:00:00","A final decision under CEAA 2012 is expected by the end of November 2022. The Proponent has indicated that should the project be allowed to proceed, which is the expected outcome, they are planning to start construction as soon as March 1, 2023. Prior to any work, undertaking, or activity that may impact fish and fish habitat, the Proponent will require a Fisheries Act Authorization (FAA). Once the application for an FAA has been received, DFO will begin Consultation with potentially impacted Indigenous communities, including Biigtigong Nishnaabeg (BN). This Consultation will include discussions surrounding the fish and fish habitat offsetting plan, which will include a discussion surrounding the hatchery as it was proposed as a potential offsetting measures.
Only a single discussion has occurred with BN and MNRF regarding the intent behind the hatchery. FFHPP recognizes that this will be a longer-term project. However, including Science and MNRF in discussions on the Fisheries Act Authorization in early 2023 would provide confidence to BN that DFO is working to support addressing the concern. Should the request be approved, 2023-24 would then be used to work with Science, BN and MNRF to fully scope the questions, and understand BN's desire to include Indigenous knowledge and indicators. Once the initial scoping is complete, DFO and MNRF can work to gather existing information in the area for fish and fish habitat, and identify any gaps and additional data collection that may be necessary to address the gap.

Additional questions for consideration:
What type of fish and fish habitat are the compensation lakes contributing relative to a. the type of habitat impacted by oil sands development and b. habitat available in the region? 

Are there data gaps that need to be addressed? Is there a framework that could be provided to support the collection of this information (ideally by proponents)?

FFHPP would benefit from further discussions on scoping and refining the question(s) with Science.","","Impacts authorized by DFO associated with oil sands mines in northeastern Alberta have primarily been the destruction of small tributaries to the Athabasca River. In contrast, the majority of the offsetting accepted by DFO has been the creation of large offsetting lakes. Indigenous communities have expressed concerns about the cumulative loss of small tributaries and their fish communities to the Athabasca River. In particular, they are concerned with lakes being constructed to offset these losses given it is not like-for-like, and what this means for fish communities in the region. While DFO has accepted lake construction in the region due to the large offsetting requirements, there remains uncertainty with respect to equivalency of impacted habitat and offsetting. 

FFHPP is participating in the impact assessment process under the Impact Assessment Act for the Suncor Base Mine Extension Project, which was referred to an independent review panel on January 28, 2021. The Proponent has until February 25, 2025 to submit an Impact Statement (IS) that includes information and studies described in the Tailored Impact Statement Guidelines. At that time, FFHPP will begin developing a submission outlining our assessment of the Proponent's IS, and opinion on the project within our mandate. Similar to previous oil sands panels, FFHPP anticipates that the panel and Indigenous communities will seek to understand cumulative effects to fish and fish habitat in the region, particularly around the loss of small tributaries and their replacement with lakes. In the past, DFO has deferred to regional monitoring programs that we do not currently participate in, or have indicated that the implementation of offsetting, if successful, should mitigate any effects that would result in a cumulative effect to fish and fish habitat. Given the explicit need to consider cumulative effects in the amended Fisheries Act and in the Impact Assessment Act, and the move to whole ecosystem management, the expectation on DFO to present a comprehensive overview of cumulative effects to fish and fish habitat in the region is likely to be high. Other ongoing processes in the region are also likely to draw attention to cumulative effects to the Athabasca River, specifically ECCC's work on the development of an oil sands tailings water release regulation. 

DFO has been unable to meaningfully address questions around cumulative effects to fish and fish habitat in the oil sands region in the past. There was some progress on developing a program that was tied to the Teck Frontier Oil Sands Project EA process, but resource requests related to it were withdrawn when the proponent withdrew the project. This presents an opportunity to begin to address the question, and support improved decision-making and planning in the future. Additionally, the assessment may identify data needs, and required analyses that oil sands operators could begin to collect to support ongoing work. 

This advice will be used to support DFO's participation in the Suncor Base Mine Extension IA process and subsequent regulatory process under the Fisheries Act, if the project is approved, and any other future IA and regulatory processes. While the primary end user is FFHPP, the development of tools during the process may be useful regional tools to support long-term analysis and reporting to the public and Indigenous communities. The framework of assessment may be applicable to other programs or regions, but the content of it will not be.","If advice is not provided, DFO will be unable to provide expert advice to the panel, Indigenous communities, and stakeholders in the region as it relates to cumulative effects to fish and fish habitat during the Suncor Base Mine Extension Project IA process. This will reduce DFO's credibility and publicly convey that DFO's assessment of cumulative effects in its Fisheries Act Authorization process is limited at best.

Specific legislated responsibilities that would be limited include - DFO's ability to contribute expert information on the cumulative effects of a proposed project under the Impact Assessment Act, Section 22(1)(ii). The FFHPP may also risk not being able to apply a precautionary approach and ecosystems approach as specified in Section 2.5 of the Fisheries Act.","2025-03-28 03:00:00","The deadline for the proponent to submit their impact statement is January 2025.

3)	Integrate Indigenous knowledge into modelling of LRPs and harvest control rules","Colin Gallagher, Kim Howland","Significant declines have been observed in several key Dolly Varden stocks in recent (the last 3-4 years) and historical (>50 years ago) time frames. Increasing concerns are being raised by fishers, Hunters and Trappers Committees (HTCs) and Renewable Resource Councils (RRCs), and regional co-management boards. Of particular concern is that a) the proximate and ultimate reason(s) for the decline in these stocks are not understood, and b) Indigenous knowledge should be more fully integrated into the understanding and management of these populations.

Among harvested stocks of anadromous Dolly Varden, three have received focused attention by co-managers: the Rat River, Big Fish, and Babbage populations. These three populations differ with respect to the extent of scientific information available for co-managers to make decisions about harvest. Indigenous knowledge could provide additional information about current and historic stock status and trends, harvest rates, and fishing practices, that can help fill temporal and geographic data gaps. 

Discussions about how to improve harvest decision-making for Dolly Varden have been ongoing among DFO Fisheries Management (DFO FM), the Gwich’in Renewable Resources Board (GRRB), the Fisheries Joint Management Committee (FJMC), and Parks Canada Agency, all of whom are signatories to the Dolly Varden Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP). This IFMP underscores the intent to follow principles of the precautionary approach – but DFO has not yet established the LRPs needed to delineate stock status zones consistent with the precautionary approach framework under Bill C-68. 

A key outcome would be to evaluate different scenarios of LRPs and harvest control rules. Ultimately the LRPs, harvest control rules, and harvest goals should be refined through a community-based peer review process that includes the HTCs and RRCs to the maximum extent possible.","-	Risk of overharvest of a COSEWIC-listed, Batch 2 (Rat River population) and likely proposed Batch 3 (Big Fish and Babbage populations) species.

- Provide estimated values of reference points, and estimate current status relative to all available reference points (Limit Reference Point, Upper Stock Reference, Removal Reference and 
  Target Reference Point) including the stock status and fishery status zone of the fish stock.
- Describe stock status trends, and if applicable, any additional indicators of importance to the stock assessment (e.g., fishing mortality, age structure, sex ratio, size distributions, etc.).    - Assess the extent of spatial-temporal overlap between 4T cod and redfish unit 1 populations and those of other commercially harvested species in which incidental catch of 4T cod is 
  considered significant;
- Determine if increasing catch legal size of 4T cod (above 43 cm) could have an impact on current population trends (size at ages 5-8 and 9+) ;
- Provide estimates of 4T cod bycatch in a future mobile-gear redfish fishery based on 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000 t TAC, and determine whether the current decline in SSB is likely 
  to intensify under any of the proposed harvest levels.
- Provide any updates to the probable factors that have led to the decline of the species and/or those that may affect rebuilding (e.g., fishing mortality, non-fishing anthropogenic factors, 
  biology of the stock, natural mortality, predator/prey interactions, environmental impacts including climate, oceanographic or ecosystem factors, habitat limitations). 
- Where possible, and relevant, identify the relative contribution of the probable causes to the decline, or those affecting or preventing rebuilding. Identify knowledge gaps.
- Identify whether habitat loss or degradation is likely or unlikely to have contributed to the stock’s decline, given the current understanding of the best available evidence. If it is a

De plus, elle préparera la définition d’indicateurs et les activités de suivi prescrites par les mesures 2.1, 2.2 et 2.3 à l’appui des objectifs de recherche.
 
Outre les objectifs spécifiques d’acquisition des connaissances sur les coraux et éponges, la Stratégie comporte aussi la prise en compte des répercussions cumulatives de toutes les activités humaines sur les écosystèmes, ce qui inclut les activités de recherche. Cette étude permettra de répondre à la problématique de la vulnérabilité des coraux et des éponges au prélèvement, soit la mesure 1.3 à l’appui des objectifs de recherche : « Minimiser le risque de dommages aux coraux et aux éponges causés par les activités de recherche, notamment les relevés au chalut. » 
 
Cette demande répond directement à l’objectif de la Stratégie de conservation des coraux et éponges. Ces organismes font partie de la biodiversité, mais sont aussi des espèces structurantes de l’habitat qui jouent un rôle dans le cycle de vie des espèces halieutiques.
 
 La conservation des coraux et éponges répond à des engagements internationaux du Canada sur la conservation des aires marines et côtières (SMDD 2002, CBD 2004, Conférence des parties CBD 2010).","la Stratégie de conservation des coraux et des éponges demande à réduire les impacts des activités de chalutage traditionnelles, y compris les activités de relevés scientifiques. Les coraux et les éponges sont considérés comme des espèces structurantes de l’habitat. En plus de nous permettre d’obtenir des données de meilleure qualité, les méthodes d’échantillonnage développées nous permettrons d’échantillonner les zones de coraux et d’éponge sans les détériorer.

Une meilleure protection des coraux et des éponges du golfe du Saint-Laurent est d’intérêt pour le public et les médias, particulièrement en raison des engagements internationaux du Canada en matière de conservation des espèces marines. Le projet nous permettra de valider l’importance des zones choisies pour la protection, possiblement de découvrir et caractériser de nouvelles zones importantes pour les coraux et les éponges et de minimiser éventuellement les impacts des activités de recherche qui pourraient faire l’objet d’une attention accrue considérant que certaines pêches commerciales ont été restreintes.","2024-03-31 03:00:00",Les méthodes élaborées suite à la présente demande pourraient être utilisées pour d’éventuels suivis des zones importantes de coraux et éponges dans lesquelles des mesures de conservation ont été établies (fermetures de pêche) depuis 2017.

Donc, cette revue scientifique répondra à un besoin de ces trois régions du MPO.","La question qui se pose et qui devrait faire l'objet d’un avis scientifique est identifier les zones d’importance écologique et biologique (ZIEB) du milieu côtier pour la biorégion de l'estuaire et du golfe du Saint-Laurent.

La Loi sur les océans confie à Pêches et Océans Canada (MPO) la direction et la coordination de l’élaboration et de la mise en œuvre d'un réseau national d'aires marines protégées, au nom du gouvernement du Canada, travail qui se poursuit dans le cadre de la planification spatiale marine. Cette priorité ministérielle repose en bonne partie sur l’identification des zones d’importance écologique et biologique (ZIEB). En 2006, le MPO a fait un large exercice de revue par les pairs afin d’identifier des ZIEB dans l’estuaire et le golfe du Saint-Laurent. Dix ZIEB avaient alors été identifiées, mais celles-ci se retrouvaient exclusivement en zone hauturière (MPO 2007). Des discussions avaient eu lieu alors sur l’inclusion des zones estuariennes et côtières dans l’évaluation des ZIEB pour le golfe sans arriver à un consensus sur une approche. La revue avait donc exclu toute la zone côtière de l’exercice de 2006.
Au cours du même atelier, on reconnaissait que l’influence des zones côtières sur le Saint-Laurent marin est probablement plus importante qu'on le pensait par le passé. De plus, il ne semble pas y avoir d’embûche majeure à utiliser un concept semblable à celui de ZIEB pour l’ensemble ou certains secteurs précis des zones côtières. Les zones côtières devraient faire l'objet d'une attention de gestion additionnelle pour les raisons suivantes : il s’agit de l’interface entre le continent et le Saint-Laurent, elles incluent des habitats productifs, leur rôle comme composante de l’écosystème est méconnu et les pressions exercées par les activités humaines y sont plus fortes qu’ailleurs et croissantes.
Afin de compléter les renseignements écologiques pour le développement d’un réseau d’aires marines protégées dans l’estuaire et le golfe du Saint-Laurent, l’identification des ZIEB en milieu côtier est ainsi devenue un élément majeur.

Ces ZIEB serviraient, entre autres, comme base pour le développement d’un réseau d’aires marines protégées pour la biorégion du golfe du Saint-Laurent. Elles contribueraient aussi à l’identification de vulnérabilités environnementales.

Comme c’était le cas dans la demande initiale, la demande touche l’ensemble du golfe Saint-Laurent et l’estuaire du Saint-Laurent, y compris le fjord du Saguenay et les côtes de Terre-Neuve.
Mentionnons qu’une première étape de cet avis a déjà eu lieu en décembre 2014. Lors de cet exercice, trois recommandations ont a été faites pour compléter l’exercice en question. Il s’agit de :
- réexaminer les autres couches d’information disponibles et pertinentes que l’on souhaite intégrer;
- revoir l’approche à prioriser pour identifier les ZIEB; et
- inclure la côte de Terre-Neuve dans l’exercice.","Certaines discussions avec des représentants des Sciences ont eu lieu à ce sujet, soit lors du processus en 2006 et en 2014.

StAR division manager.,"The 2020 stock assessment for Pacific Cod found the Area 3CD (West Coast of Vancouver Island) stock to be in the Cautious Zone. This assessment followed a notable reduction in the 2018 3CD survey index (approximately 25% of the previous two observations). The commercial CPUE index has also decreased since 2016. Due to COVID-19, the scheduled 2020 synoptic bottom trawl survey in Area 3CD did not occur. The 2020 Science Response therefore recommended updating the assessment when new survey information became available. The survey was conducted in 2021 and 2022, with both index points being of a similar low magnitude to the 2018 observation.

Recent 3CD commercial catches of Pacific Cod continue to be low, with the 2020 stock assessment estimating fishing mortality rates of < 1%. Therefore, updated catch advice has not been requested by Fisheries Management. However, given the three low index points in 2018, 2021 and 2022, Science is requesting a stock status update to ensure all three of these index points are considered in the timely evaluation of stock status.

The current delay-difference model used for the assessment relies on an index of mean weight in the commercial fishery, which is derived from commercial length samples collected at sea. Since 2014, there has been a notable decline in commercial sampling effort for Pacific Cod, with commercial sampling ceasing altogether in 2020 following the COVID-19 pandemic and changes to the at-sea observer program. The Pacific Cod Technical Working Group (TWG) met in 2022 and evaluated a generalised linear model (GLM) for predicting the commercial mean weight index from a mean weight index derived from survey samples. The TWG found that the GLM provided a reasonable prediction of the commercial mean weight index for Area 3CD.

Therefore, Science is requesting a stock status update for 3CD Pacific Cod as a Science Response. The update will use the same model configurations as the 2020 assessment, including model-averaged stock status based on the same seven sensitivity analyses as in 2020. The commercial mean weight index will be derived from the GLM presented to the TWG in 2022. Any updates to the GLM will be presented to the TWG prior to completing the Science Response.",A stock status update will determine whether or not the stock has entered into the Critical Zone following the declines in the indices of abundance.,"2023-06-30 03:00:00","Since there will be no catch advice resulting from the SR, set the deadline earlier in the year to avoid clashes with other advisory processes in the fall.",0,"",1,Concerns about the apparent persistent decline in abundance based on index data.,70,"2022-12-15 00:31:29.926507",,1414,1414,93,1500,,"2022SCI03",2024,2023,5

DFO and partners are currently working toward the development of sufficient broodstock to establish a breeding program and make progress towards these recovery goals. As a first step, DFO recently established an 'Atlantic Whitefish Range Expansion Initiative Working Group' comprised of both internal sectors and external partners who have been reviewing existing information and advice to inform the selection of appropriate candidate locations to support the Atlantic Whitefish recovery goal of 'range expansion'. The recent Conservation Translocation Framework CSAS process provides a tool to assess the probability of achieving objectives and help evaluate candidate locations to improve the species survival and recovery. This science advisory request will be used by Maritimes Region Species at Risk and Science Programs, and their external partners, to develop and subsequently implement Atlantic Whitefish range expansion operational plans.

The evaluation of appropriate candidate locations to support range expansion would also be less robust which may result in not selecting the location with the highest probability of achieving objectives, which may ultimately impact on the success of the recovery effort, costing the department and their partners time, money and a sense of failure. Given that DFO Maritimes Region has committed to advancing the range expansion initiative for Atlantic Whitefish and established a multi-partner working group to inform this initiative under a 5-year stepped approach, the consequence of not having the science advice in a timely manner would hinder progress and planned next steps and impact senior management expectations.","2023-06-15 03:00:00","The ""earliest possible"" in the 2023-24 fiscal is the deadline for this advice.

Conformément au protocole établi, les spécimens récoltés dans le cadre de projet doivent être mesurés et leurs estomacs et otolithes prélevés et envoyés aux Sciences pour analyse(s) subséquente(s).

Un support est demandé aux Sciences en vue de :
- traiter et analyser des échantillons récupérés (contenus stomacaux et lecture des otolithes, en collaboration avec l'UQAC);
- analyser les données (longueur, poids, sexe, diète, composition chimique des otolithes) et les résultats obtenus;
- évaluer la contribution du projet à l'accroissement des connaissances sur la population de flétan du Saguenay (distribution, déplacements, abondance et productivité); 
- présenter les résultats, s'il y a lieu, au promoteur et partenaires du projet;
- participer à l'identification des options quant aux suites à donner au projet. 

Une contribution sera également demandée aux Sciences en vue de : 
- évaluer, si possible, les impacts potentiels d'activités de pêche récréative sur le stock de flétan atlantique du golfe du Saint-Laurent de même que sur les ressources halieutiques, principalement le poisson de fond, du fjord du Saguenay (engagement régional pris dans la note d'approbation du projet signée en juin 2021);

Le projet actuel, initié par le Comité de bassin de la baie des Ha! Ha! (CBBH) en collaboration avec le MPO vise, entre autres, à permettre la pêche récréative du flétan atlantique, à récolter des données scientifiques ainsi qu’à bien encadrer ces activités dans une perspective de développement socio-économique régional.  

Ce projet de pêche scientifique pourrait contribuer à déterminer si les flétans atlantiques qui entrent dans le fjord du Saguenay constituent, à l’instar de d’autres espèces de poisson de fond, une « population puits », de sorte qu’une fois entrés dans le Fjord, ils y passent la majorité de leur vie. La réalisation du projet pilote présenté par CBBH pourrait permettre de documenter l’impact des activités de pêche récréative du flétan au Saguenay sur le stock du Golfe, le cas échéant. 

Ce projet revêt une importance pour les organismes de promotion d’activités de plein air et les intervenants socio-économiques de la région du Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. L'ouverture d'une pêche récréative hivernale du flétan permettrait de bonifier l’offre récréotouristique durant la période hivernale, un moteur économique d’importance dans la région du Saguenay. 

Bien que les impacts de la réalisation de ce projet devraient être limités aux populations de poissons de fond du Saguenay et s’avérer nuls pour le stock de flétan atlantique du golfe, un tel projet pilote suscitera certainement des réactions de la part des pêcheurs commerciaux en plus de susciter l’intérêt des pêcheurs récréatifs, organisations de pêcheurs et organismes de promotion des activités récréotouristiques ailleurs dans le golfe.

These low escapements have persisted despite overall exploitation rates that are in the range of 20% annually.  The 2019-2021 average exploitation rate for Canadian ISBM fisheries is also above the limit identified in Pacific Salmon Treaty Chapter 3, triggering a requirement to implement actions to reduce the exploitation rate on this stock to below the limit.

While fishery management actions will need to be considered under the Treaty, there is a need to reassess the escapement goal based on recent productivity.  An updated escapement goal for Harrison Chinook (if appropriate) would set a realistic target for fisheries management and identify the level of abundance consistent with the stock being in the healthy zone.  It is important to periodically review and update escapement goals as new information becomes available and as the circumstances affecting the population change. A clearly-defined escapement goal target for Harrison Chinook salmon should be developed to guide future management responses.","This assessment is required to support ongoing implementation of the Pacific salmon treaty and will also support implementation of the new Fish Stocks Provisions in the Fisheries Act which will require identification of limit reference point to support determination of stock status.

Quel est l'origine génétique des bélugas qui fréquentent la zone de l'estuaire de la Mucalic ?",Anne Provencher St-Pierre,"La chasse du béluga est très importante pour les communautés du Nunavik tant d'un point de vue culturel qu'au niveau de la sécurité alimentaire des communautés. Or, le COSEPAC a désigné la population de Béluga de la baie d'Ungava (BU)en voie de disparition. On estime que cette population serait composée de moins de 100 individus.
Afin de protéger cette population, l'estuaire de la Mucalic est fermé aux activités de chasse depuis plus de 30 ans par règlement. Depuis la mise en œuvre du plan de gestion, des activités de chasse limitées peuvent y être autorisées au cas par cas sous réserve de l'approbation du Ministre.
L'identification de la population de la baie d'Ungava est fondée sur des observations historiques. Toutefois, le nombre d’échantillons existants ne permet plus de déterminer s’il s’agit d’une population distincte de celles de l’Est et de l’Ouest de la Baie d’Hudson. De plus, lors des relevés des populations de béluga au Nunavik par recensement aérien en 2011 et 2015, la Baie d’Ungava n’a pu être couverte pour des raisons logistiques. 
Selon les chasseurs Inuit des communautés environnantes, les bélugas qui fréquentent l’estuaire de la Mucalic ne seraient pas génétiquement différents de ceux se retrouvent dans le Détroit d’Hudson et dans le Baie d’Ungava. Leur abondance serait liée à différents facteurs environnementaux dont la présence tardive de glace dans le Détroit. Les communautés de Kuujjuaq et de Kangiqsualujjuaq exercent alors des pressions sur le Conseil de gestion  des ressources fauniques de la région marine du Nunavik pour que cette zone puisse être rouverte à la chasse.
Un projet de recherche a été convenu entre les Sciences et le Conseil de gestion des ressources fauniques de la Région marine du Nunavik. Le Conseil a exigé que les Sciences conviennent avec le RNUK des méthodes de recherche à employer : au cours de l’année 2019, des observateurs sur le terrain ont noté la fréquentation, effectué des biopsies par arbalètes ainsi que des prélèvements d’eau (ADN environnemental). Des images satellitaires ont également été analysées.
Cette demande d’avis vise d’une part à obtenir le support des Sciences pour l’analyse des échantillons, pour l’acquisition de données complémentaires et pour un avis sur l’origine des bélugas de l’estuaire de la Mucalic.

Live fish, representative of the local fish community, were flushed through a VLH turbine to estimate expected injury and mortality rates for resident fish that pass through the VLH turbines. Together, the likelihood of entrainment and risk of injury from turbine passage can be used to provide an estimate of the overall risk to the fish populations upstream of VLH.

•	When are the peak spawning times (a range of dates is fine) or spawning season, for the following species on Great Slave Lake (GSL):
o	Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis)
o	Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycuch)
o	Inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys)
o	Walleye (Sander vitreus)
o	Northern Pike (Esox Lucius)
o	Goldeye (Hiodon alosoides)
o	Lake Cisco (Coregonus artedii)
o	Burbot (Lota lota)
o	Catostomus sp.

•	Do we know where these fishes spawn? Provide detail to the extent practical. i.e. which rivers are used as spawning grounds, or are high traffic areas?
•	How frequently do each of these species spawn? (Question inspired by Kennedy, 1953)
•	Has critical or preferred habitat in GSL been identified for any of these species? (i.e. bottom characteristics, flow, feeding benthic vs pelagic, preferred depth for feeding vs spawning)",Yamin Janjua (Kim Howland) and Brendan Malley (Xinhua Zhu),"Understanding the spawning seasons and preferred habitat of fishes in the GSL multispecies fishery, and notably critical stocks such as Inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys) will help Fisheries Management to navigate new fisheries management decisions with the aim of conserving fish during their most vulnerable and important season: spawning. We will be using the advice to revise existing management measures, polygon closures, and potentially add increased protective closures to commercial fishing during spawning runs for critical stocks. This should not impact other DFO programs, regions or rights based fishers.","If science advice is not provided, the current management measures will stay in place on Great Slave Lake. This could be impacting the fish stocks that are heavily targeted during possible spawning seasons currently, and we would like to be able to move forward with a new management plan based on sound science advice, rather than maintaining the status quo for another stock assessment cycle.

This request is related to the conservation, biodiversity and productivity of fish stocks on Great Slave Lake. Locations and timing of fish stock spawning should be considered. This request will help DFO move towards an ecosystem approach to management.

As per Fisheries Act provisions:
6.1 (1) In the management of fisheries, the Minister shall implement measures to maintain major fish stocks at or above the level necessary to promote the sustainability of the stock.
6.1 (2) If the Minister is of the opinion that such a plan could result in adverse socio-economic or cultural impacts, the Minister may amend the plan or the implementation period in order to mitigate those impacts while minimizing further decline of the fish stock.
9.1 (1) The Minister may, if he or she is of the opinion that prompt measures are required to address a threat to the proper management and control of fisheries and the conservation and protection of fish, make a fisheries management order with respect to any aspect of fisheries in any area of Canadian fisheries waters.","2023-08-31 03:00:00","This advice will allow DFO FM to address motions moved by the Great Slave Lake Advisory Committee (GSLAC) at the May and November, 2022, meetings. We would like to have a strategy to implement new management measures ahead of the fall season, and have an open discussion at the fall GSLAC meeting in November 2023. It also will allow DFO FM to identify risks and uncertainties in the decision-making process.",0,"",1,"Due to the ongoing GSL Multispecies CSAS process, this is our time to submit requests for supplementary information that may not be covered within the stock assessment framework.

Currently no Chinook salmon escapement goals exist for the Skeena River, while Nass Chinook escapement goals have not been updated to be consistent with contemporary information and analytical methods.

Domestically, escapement goals for Nass and Skeena Chinook Salmon are required as the biological basis for harvest control rules and designing robust fisheries management actions that protect the Conservation Units from overexploitation. Defining clear escapement goals will allow fishery management to develop fishing plans and clearly communicate levels of harvest acceptable to First Nations and stakeholders interested in accessing the resource. 

Skeena Chinook salmon are an Attachment I stock under Chapter 3 of the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) and as such are subject to Individual Stock Based Management obligations (Calendar Year Exploitation Rate limit) but do not have a formal escapement goal. Along with the Skeena, Nass Chinook salmon are also part of Northern BC stock aggregate in the PST Chinook Technical Committee’s Chinook Model and require a formal escapement goal to manage fishery impact and monitor status under the treaty.","The lack of escapement goals presents challenges to fisheries management and does not meet the Wild Salmon Policy requirements for biological benchmarks and assessment of status.  Domestic management actions will continue to be implemented with uncertainty regarding whether current levels of harvest impair recovery of Skeena and Nass Chinook to historical levels of abundance. 

Internationally, Canada will continue to not meet the obligations set out in Chapter 3 of the Pacific Salmon Treaty to have escapement goals defined for Attachment I stocks.","2025-12-31 04:00:00",Timeline discussed among resource management and science staff that this project could be delivered and allow for subsequent consultation on harvest control rules prior to the 2026 fishing season.,1,North Coast stock assessment has committed to covering the cost of an external facilitator for the 2023-2024 fiscal year.

La chasse n’est actuellement encadrée que par le Règlement sur le Mammifères Marins qui permet aux Inuit la capture de 4 morses par personne par année. Toutefois, au Nunavik, le nombre de morses chassés par année est, depuis 2010, inférieur à 10. 

Jusqu’à récemment, on ne disposait d'aucune donnée sur les morses du sud de la baie d’Hudson et de données fragmentaires pour estimer l’abondance de la population Baie d'Hudson et du détroit de Davis. Les résultats de l’inventaire aérien réalisé en 2014 suggèrent que le nombre de morses qui fréquentent le secteur Baie d’Hudson – Détroit de Davis se serait stabilisé ou aurait augmenté légèrement. Toutefois, dans le secteur Sud et Est de la Baie d’Hudson, leur nombre serait peu élevé. Les résultats du plus récent inventaire réalisé en 2017 ne couvraient pas le secteur Sud et Est de la Baie d’Hudson. Bien que des analyses basées sur des données isotopiques du plomb semblent différencier les animaux du Sud et de l’Est de la Baie d’Hudson de ceux faisant partie du stock Baie d’Hudson - Détroit de Davis, le nombre limité d’échantillons génétiques disponibles ne permet pas d’établir si ces morses forment une population distincte ou s’ils représentent la limite sud de l’aire de distribution du stock Baie d’Hudson – détroit de Davis.

Compte tenu de ces incertitudes, nous demandons au secteur des Sciences de déterminer le niveau d'abondance de la population de morses du Sud de la Baie d’Hudson ainsi que le prélèvement biologique potentiel. Cela permettra d’établir si nécessaire, des mesures de gestion spécifiques à ces morses qui sont aussi potentiellement chassés à Sanikiluaq (Nunavut), s'ils forment bel et bien une population distincte. Les priorités visées par cette demande sont : la conservation du morse et une chasse alimentaire, sociale et rituelle durable.

Cette demande permettrait d’améliorer l’efficacité de la gestion actuelle par rapport aux objectifs de conservation et de développer un plan de gestion intégré de la chasse au morse. Le statut actuel de l’espèce est, selon le COSEPAC, préoccupant. L’objectif général d’un plan intégré est d’encadrer la conservation et l’utilisation durable des ressources marines.",Le MPO n'est pas en mesure d'évaluer précisément l'impact des prélèvements par la chasse de subsistance en l'absence de données d'abondance et de prélèvement biologique potentiel concernant le morses du sud de la baie d’Hudson. Une bonne connaissance de l'état de la population est nécessaire afin d'ajuster les mesures de gestion et le niveaux de prélèvements recommandés pour garantir au minimum une stabilité des stocks.,"2024-03-31 03:00:00",Date préliminaire déterminée sur la base de discussions avec les Sciences.
